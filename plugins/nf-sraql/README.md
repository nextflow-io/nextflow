# SraQL plugin for Nextflow

This plugin provides an extension to channels, implementing a built-in support for querying the SRA metadata available
on Google BigQuery and AWS Athena in Nextflow scripts.

It provides the ability to create a Nextflow channel from SQL queries and to populate the channel.
