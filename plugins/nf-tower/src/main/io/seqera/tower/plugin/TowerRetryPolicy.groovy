/**
 * Configuration class for Tower retry policy settings.
 * 
 * This class defines the retry behavior for Tower operations including HTTP requests
 * and other potentially failing operations. It implements exponential backoff with 
 * jitter to handle transient failures gracefully.
 * 
 * The retry policy supports:
 * - Configurable initial delay before the first retry attempt
 * - Maximum delay cap to prevent excessively long wait times
 * - Limited number of retry attempts to avoid infinite loops
 * - Jitter randomization to prevent thundering herd problems
 * - Exponential backoff multiplier for progressive delay increases
