# 24.04

[Nextflow 24.04](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow/releases/tag/v24.04.0) was released on May 20, 2024.

## New features

### Topic channels (first preview)

A topic channel is a queue channel that can receive values from multiple sources based on a matching name or *topic*.

Topic channels are particularly useful for collecting metadata from various places in the pipeline, without needing to write all of the channel logic that is normally required (e.g. using the `mix` operator).

See {ref}`channel-topic` for details.

### `eval` outputs

A process `eval` output is a new type of process output which allows you to capture the standard output of an arbitrary shell command.

The `eval` output is a useful shorthand for capturing command outputs, such as the version of a command line tool, without needing to execute the command in the task script and capturing it with a `path` or `env` output.

See {ref}`process-out-eval` for details.

### Resource limits

The `resourceLimits` process directive allows you to define global limits on the resources requested by individual tasks.

This directive is useful for ensuring that a task's resource requirements never exceed system-wide limits, especially when using {ref}`retry with dynamic resources <dynamic-task-resources>`, thus preventing the task from becoming unschedulable.

See {ref}`process-resourcelimits` for details.

### Job arrays

The `array` directive allows a process to submit jobs as *job arrays*, which are supported by many batch schedulers as a way to submit many similar jobs in an efficient way.

:::{tip}
On Google Batch, the `array` directive can be used in conjunction with the `cpus`, `memory`, and `machineType` directives to pack multiple tasks onto the same VM.

See {ref}`process-array` for details.

### Workflow outputs (first preview)

Workflow outputs are a new way to publish outputs at the workflow level:

```nextflow
nextflow.preview.output = true

workflow {
  main:
  ch_foo = foo(data)
  bar(ch_foo)

  publish:
  ch_foo >> 'foo'
}

output {
  directory 'results'
  mode 'copy'
}
```

This syntax allows you to publish channels in a workflow, instead of publishing file patterns in a process using `publishDir`.

See {ref}`workflow-output-def` for details.

## Enhancements

### Colored logs

Nextflow's console output now features colored logs and improved organization to highglight the most important information about a pipeline while its running.

### AWS Fargate

Nextflow now supports AWS Fargate for AWS Batch jobs. See {ref}`aws-fargate` for details.

### OCI auto-pull mode for Singularity and Apptainer

The `singularity.ociAutoPull` (`apptainer.ociAutoPull`) config option enables OCI auto-pull mode for Singularity (Apptainer). This setting allows Singularity (Apptainer) to download and convert a Docker image during the task execution instead of the Nextflow head node.

See {ref}`config-singularity` and {ref}`config-apptainer` for details.

### GA4GH TES 1.1

The TES executor has been updated to be compliant with version 1.1 of the [TES API specification](https://ga4gh.github.io/task-execution-schemas/docs/). Notable improvements include support for directory outputs, glob outputs, and the `bin` directory.

:::{note}
The nf-ga4gh plugin has since been moved into its own repository, [nextflow-io/nf-ga4gh](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nf-ga4gh). Refer to this repository for documentation and the latest updates on GA4GH integrations for Nextflow.

## Deprecations and removals

- Support for {ref}`Glacier auto-retrieval <config-aws>` was removed. Consider using the AWS CLI to restore Glacier objects before or at the beginning of your pipeline.

- The `seqera` and `defaults` channels were removed from the default list of Conda channels used by Wave. They can be restored using the following setting:
  ```groovy
  conda.channels = ['seqera', 'conda-forge', 'bioconda', 'defaults']
  ```
