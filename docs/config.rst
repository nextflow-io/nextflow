Configuration file
==================

When a pipeline script is launched, Nextflow looks for configuration files in multiple locations.
Since each configuration file can contain conflicting settings, the sources are ranked to decide which
settings to are applied. All possible configuration sources are reported below, listed in order
of priority:

1. Parameters specified on the command line (``--something value``)
2. Parameters provided using the ``-params-file`` option
3. Config file specified using the ``-c my_config`` option
4. The config file named ``nextflow.config`` in the current directory
5. The config file named ``nextflow.config`` in the workflow project directory
6. The config file ``$HOME/.nextflow/config``
7. Values defined within the pipeline script itself (e.g. ``main.nf``)

When more than one of these ways of specifying configurations are used, they are merged, so that the settings in the
first override the same ones that may appear in the second one, and so on.

.. tip:: If you want to ignore any default configuration files and use only the custom one use the command line option
  ``-C <config file>``.

Config syntax
--------------

A Nextflow configuration file is a simple text file containing a set of properties defined using the syntax::

  name = value

Please note, string values need to be wrapped in quotation characters while numbers and boolean values (``true``, ``false``) do not.
Also note that values are typed, meaning for example that, ``1`` is different from ``'1'``, since the first is interpreted
as the number one, while the latter is interpreted as a string value.


Config Variables
----------------

Configuration properties can be used as variables in the configuration file itself, by using the usual
``$propertyName`` or ``${expression}`` syntax.


For example::

     propertyOne = 'world'
     anotherProp = "Hello $propertyOne"
     customPath = "$PATH:/my/app/folder"

Please note, the usual rules for :ref:`string-interpolation` are applied, thus a string containing a variable
reference must be wrapped in double-quote chars instead of single-quote chars.

The same mechanism allows you to access environment variables defined in the hosting system. Any variable whose name is
not defined in the Nextflow configuration file(s) is supposed to be a reference to an environment variable with that name.
So, in the above example the property ``customPath`` is defined as the current system ``PATH`` to which
the string ``/my/app/folder`` is appended.


Config comments
------------------

Configuration files use the same conventions for comments used by the Groovy or Java programming languages. Thus, use ``//`` to comment
a single line or ``/*`` .. ``*/`` to comment a block on multiple lines.


Config include
--------------

A configuration file can include one or more configuration files using the keyword ``includeConfig``. For example::

    process.executor = 'sge'
    process.queue = 'long'
    process.memory = '10G'

    includeConfig 'path/foo.config'

When a relative path is used, it is resolved against the actual location of the including file.


Config scopes
=============

Configuration settings can be organized in different scopes by dot prefixing the property names with a scope
identifier or grouping the properties in the same scope using the curly brackets notation. This is shown in the
following example::

   alpha.x  = 1
   alpha.y  = 'string value..'

   beta {
        p = 2
        q = 'another string ..'
   }


.. _config-env:

Scope `env`
-----------

The ``env`` scope allows the definition one or more variable that will be exported in the environment where the
workflow tasks will be executed.

Simply prefix your variable names with the ``env`` scope or surround them by curly brackets, as shown below::

   env.ALPHA = 'some value'
   env.BETA = "$HOME/some/path"

   env {
        DELTA = 'one more'
        GAMMA = "/my/path:$PATH"
   }


Scope `params`
--------------

The ``params`` scope allows you to define parameters that will be accessible in the pipeline script. Simply prefix the
parameter names with the ``params`` scope or surround them by curly brackets, as shown below::

     params.custom_param = 123
     params.another_param = 'string value .. '

     params {

        alpha_1 = true
        beta_2 = 'another string ..'

     }



.. _config-process:

Scope `process`
---------------

The ``process`` configuration scope allows you to provide the default configuration for the processes in your pipeline.

You can specify here any property described in the :ref:`process directive<process-directives>` and the executor sections.
For examples::

  process {
    executor='sge'
    queue='long'
    clusterOptions = '-pe smp 10 -l virtual_free=64G,h_rt=30:00:00'
  }


By using this configuration all processes in your pipeline will be executed through the SGE cluster, with the specified
settings.

.. _config-process-selectors:

Process selectors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``withLabel`` selectors allow the configuration of all processes annotated with a :ref:`process-label` directive as
shown below::

    process {
        withLabel: big_mem {
            cpus = 16
            memory = 64.GB
            queue = 'long'
        }
    }

The above configuration example assigns 16 cpus, 64 Gb of memory and the ``long`` queue to all processes annotated
with the ``big_mem`` label.


In the same manner, the ``withName`` selector allows the configuration of a specific process in your pipeline by its name.
For example::

    process {
        withName: hello {
            cpus = 4
            memory = 8.GB
            queue = 'short'
        }
    }

.. tip:: Either label and process names do not need to be enclosed with quote characters, provided the name
  does include special characters (e.g. ``-``, ``!``, etc) or it's not a keyword or a built-in type identifier.
  In case of doubt, you can enclose the label names or the process names with single or double quote characters.

.. _config-selector-expressions:

Selector expressions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Both label and process name selectors allow the use of a regular expression in order to apply the same configuration
to all processes matching the specified pattern condition. For example::

    process {
        withLabel: 'foo|bar' {
            cpus = 2
            memory = 4.GB
        }
    }

The above configuration snippet sets 2 cpus and 4 GB of memory to the processes annotated with with a label ``foo``
and ``bar``.

A process selector can be negated prefixing it with the special character ``!``. For example::

    process {
        withLabel: 'foo' { cpus = 2 }
        withLabel: '!foo' { cpus = 4 }
        withName: '!align.*' { queue = 'long' }
    }

The above configuration snippet sets 2 cpus for the processes annotated with the ``foo`` label and 4 cpus to all processes
*not* annotated with that label. Finally it sets the use of ``long`` queue to all process whose name does *not* start
with ``align``.

.. _config-selectors-priority:

Selectors priority
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When mixing generic process configuration and selectors the following priority rules are applied (from lower to higher):

1. Process generic configuration.
2. Process specific directive defined in the workflow script.
3. ``withLabel`` selector definition.
4. ``withName`` selector definition.

For example::

    process {
        cpus = 4
        withLabel: foo { cpus = 8 }
        withName: bar { cpus = 32 }
    }

Using the above configuration snippet, all workflow processes use 4 cpus if not otherwise specified in the workflow
script. Moreover processes annotated with the ``foo`` label use 8 cpus. Finally the process named ``bar``
uses 32 cpus.


.. _config-executor:

Scope `executor`
----------------

The ``executor`` configuration scope allows you to set the optional executor settings, listed in the following table.

===================== =====================
Name                  Description
===================== =====================
name                  The name of the executor to be used e.g. ``local``, ``sge``, etc.
queueSize             The number of tasks the executor will handle in a parallel manner (default: ``100``).
pollInterval          Determines how often a poll occurs to check for a process termination.
dumpInterval          Determines how often the executor status is written in the application log file (default: ``5min``).
queueStatInterval     Determines how often the queue status is fetched from the cluster system. This setting is used only by grid executors (default: ``1min``).
exitReadTimeout       Determines how long the executor waits before return an error status when a process is terminated but the `exit` file does not exist or it is empty. This setting is used only by grid executors (default: ``270 sec``).
killBatchSize         Determines the number of jobs that can be `killed` in a single command execution (default: ``100``).
submitRateLimit       Determines the max rate of jobs that can be executed per time unit, for example ``'10 sec'`` eg. max 10 jobs per second (default: `unlimited`).
perJobMemLimit        Specifies Platform LSF *per-job* memory limit mode. See :ref:`lsf-executor`.
jobName               Determines the name of jobs submitted to the underlying cluster executor e.g. ``executor.jobName = { "$task.name - $task.hash" }`` .
cpus                  The maximum number of CPUs made available by the underlying system (only used by the ``local`` executor).
memory                The maximum amount of memory made available by the underlying system (only used by the ``local`` executor).
===================== =====================



The executor settings can be defined as shown below::

    executor {
        name = 'sge'
        queueSize = 200
        pollInterval = '30 sec'
    }


When using two (or more) different executors in your pipeline, you can specify their settings separately by prefixing
the executor name with the symbol ``$`` and using it as special scope identifier. For example::

  executor {
    $sge {
        queueSize = 100
        pollInterval = '30sec'
    }

    $local {
        cpus = 8
        memory = '32 GB'
    }
  }

The above configuration example can be rewritten using the dot notation as shown below::

    executor.$sge.queueSize = 100
    executor.$sge.pollInterval = '30sec'
    executor.$local.cpus = 8
    executor.$local.memory = '32 GB'

.. _config-timeline:

Scope `timeline`
----------------

The ``timeline`` scope allows you to enable/disable the processes execution timeline report generated by Nextflow.

The following settings are available:

================== ================
Name                Description
================== ================
enabled             When ``true`` turns on the generation of the timeline report file (default: ``false``).
file                Timeline file name (default: ``timeline.html``).
overwrite           When ``true`` overwrites an existing timeline file instead of rolling it.
================== ================

.. _config-mail:

Scope `mail`
------------

The ``mail`` scope allows you to define the mail server configuration settings needed to send email messages.

================== ================
Name                Description
================== ================
from                Default email sender address.
smtp.host           Host name of the mail server.
smtp.port           Port number of the mail server.
smtp.user           User name to connect to  the mail server.
smtp.password       User password to connect to the mail server.
smtp.proxy.host     Host name of an HTTP web proxy server that will be used for connections to the mail server.
smtp.proxy.port     Port number for the HTTP web proxy server.
smtp.*              Any SMTP configuration property supported by the Java Mail API (see link below).
debug               When ``true`` enables Java Mail logging for debugging purpose.
================== ================

.. note:: Nextflow relies on the `Java Mail API <https://javaee.github.io/javamail/>`_ to send email messages.
  Advanced mail configuration can be provided by using any SMTP configuration property supported by the Java Mail API.
  See the `table of available properties at this link <https://javaee.github.io/javamail/docs/api/com/sun/mail/smtp/package-summary.html#properties>`_.

For example, the following snippet shows how to configure Nextflow to send emails through the
`AWS Simple Email Service <https://aws.amazon.com/ses/>`_::

    mail {
        smtp.host = 'email-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com'
        smtp.port = 587
        smtp.user = '<Your AWS SES access key>'
        smtp.password = '<Your AWS SES secret key>'
        smtp.auth = true
        smtp.starttls.enable = true
        smtp.starttls.required = true
    }

.. _config-notification:

Scope `notification`
--------------------

The ``notification`` scope allows you to define the automatic sending of a notification email message
when the workflow execution terminates.

================== ================
Name                Description
================== ================
enabled             Enables the sending of a notification message when the workflow execution completes.
to                  Recipient address for the notification email. Multiple addresses can be specified separating them with a comma.

template            Path of a template file which provides the content of the notification message.
binding             An associative array modelling the variables in the template file.
================== ================

The notification message is sent my using the STMP server defined in the configuration :ref:`mail scope<config-mail>`.

If no mail configuration is provided, it tries to send the notification message by using the external mail command
eventually provided by the underlying system (eg. ``sendmail`` or ``mail``).

.. _config-report:

--------------

The ``report`` scope allows you to define configuration setting of the workflow :ref:`execution-report`.

================== ================

================== ================
enabled             If ``true`` it will send HTTP POST requests to a given url.
url                The url where to send HTTP POST requests (default: ``http:localhost``).
================== ================


.. _config-profiles:

Config profiles
===============

Configuration files can contain the definition of one or more *profiles*. A profile is a set of configuration attributes
that can be activated/chosen when launching a pipeline execution by using the ``-profile`` command line option.

Configuration profiles are defined by using the special scope ``profiles`` which group the attributes that belong
to the same profile using a common prefix. For example::

    profiles {

        standard {
            process.executor = 'local'
        }

        cluster {
            process.executor = 'sge'
            process.queue = 'long'
            process.memory = '10GB'
        }

        cloud {
            process.executor = 'cirrus'
            process.container = 'cbcrg/imagex'
            docker.enabled = true
        }

    }


This configuration defines three different profiles: ``standard``, ``cluster`` and ``cloud`` that set different process
configuration strategies depending on the target runtime platform. By convention the ``standard`` profile is implicitly used
when no other profile is specified by the user.

.. tip:: Two or more configuration profiles can be specified by separating the profile names
    with a comma character, for example::

        nextflow run <your script> -profile standard,cloud



.. danger:: When using the *profiles* feature in your config file do NOT set attributes in the same scope both
  inside and outside a ``profiles`` context. For example::

        process.cpus = 1

        profiles {
          foo {
            process.memory = '2 GB'
          }

          bar {
            process.memory = '4 GB'
          }
        }

  In the above example the ``process.cpus`` attribute is not correctly applied because the ``process`` scope is also
  used in the ``foo`` and ``bar`` profile contexts.

The above feature requires version 0.28.x or higher.
