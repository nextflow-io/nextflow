Configuration file
==================

When a pipeline script is launched, Nextflow looks for configuration files in multiple locations.
Since each configuration file can contain conflicting settings, the sources are ranked to decide which
settings to are applied. All possible configuration sources are reported below, listed in order
of priority:

1. Parameters specified on the command line (``--something value``)
2. Parameters provided using the ``-params-file`` option
3. Config file specified using the ``-c my_config`` option
4. The config file named ``nextflow.config`` in the current directory
5. The config file named ``nextflow.config`` in the workflow project directory
6. The config file ``$HOME/.nextflow/config``
7. Values defined within the pipeline script itself (e.g. ``main.nf``)

When more than one of these ways of specifying configurations are used, they are merged, so that the settings in the
first override the same ones that may appear in the second one, and so on.

.. tip::
  If you want to ignore any default configuration files and use only the custom one, use ``-C <config file>``.


Config syntax
-------------

A Nextflow configuration file is a simple text file containing a set of properties defined using the syntax::

  name = value

Please note, string values need to be wrapped in quotation characters while numbers and boolean values (``true``, ``false``) do not.
Also note that values are typed, meaning for example that, ``1`` is different from ``'1'``, since the first is interpreted
as the number one, while the latter is interpreted as a string value.


Config variables
----------------

Configuration properties can be used as variables in the configuration file itself, by using the usual
``$propertyName`` or ``${expression}`` syntax.

For example::

     propertyOne = 'world'
     anotherProp = "Hello $propertyOne"
     customPath = "$PATH:/my/app/folder"

Please note, the usual rules for :ref:`string-interpolation` are applied, thus a string containing a variable
reference must be wrapped in double-quote chars instead of single-quote chars.

The same mechanism allows you to access environment variables defined in the hosting system. Any variable whose name is
not defined in the Nextflow configuration file(s) is supposed to be a reference to an environment variable with that name.
So, in the above example the property ``customPath`` is defined as the current system ``PATH`` to which
the string ``/my/app/folder`` is appended.


Config comments
---------------

Configuration files use the same conventions for comments used by the Groovy or Java programming languages. Thus, use ``//`` to comment
a single line or ``/*`` .. ``*/`` to comment a block on multiple lines.


Config include
--------------

A configuration file can include one or more configuration files using the keyword ``includeConfig``. For example::

    process.executor = 'sge'
    process.queue = 'long'
    process.memory = '10G'

    includeConfig 'path/foo.config'

When a relative path is used, it is resolved against the actual location of the including file.


Config scopes
=============

Configuration settings can be organized in different scopes by dot prefixing the property names with a scope
identifier or grouping the properties in the same scope using the curly brackets notation. This is shown in the
following example::

   alpha.x  = 1
   alpha.y  = 'string value..'

   beta {
        p = 2
        q = 'another string ..'
   }


.. _config-aws:

Scope `aws`
-----------

The ``aws`` scope allows you to configure the access to Amazon S3 storage. Use the attributes ``accessKey`` and ``secretKey``
to specify your bucket credentials. For example::

brackets. For example::

    dag {
        enabled = true
        file = 'pipeline_dag.html'
    }

To learn more about the execution graph that can be generated by Nextflow read :ref:`dag-visualisation` documentation page.


.. _config-docker:

Scope `docker`
--------------

The ``docker`` configuration scope controls how `Docker <https://www.docker.com>`_ containers are executed by Nextflow.

The following settings are available:

================== ================
Name                Description

================== ================

The above options can be used by prefixing them with the ``docker`` scope or surrounding them by curly
brackets, as shown below::

    process.container = 'nextflow/examples'

    docker {
        enabled = true
        temp = 'auto'
    }

Read :ref:`container-docker` page to learn more about how to use Docker containers with Nextflow.


.. _config-env:

Scope `env`
-----------

The ``env`` scope allows the definition one or more variable that will be exported in the environment where the
workflow tasks will be executed.

Simply prefix your variable names with the ``env`` scope or surround them by curly brackets, as shown below::

   env.ALPHA = 'some value'
   env.BETA = "$HOME/some/path"

   env {
        DELTA = 'one more'
        GAMMA = "/my/path:$PATH"
   }

.. note::
  In the above example, variables like ``$HOME`` and ``$PATH`` are evaluated when the workflow is launched. If
  you want these variables to be evaluated during task execution, escape them with ``\$``. This difference is important
  for variables like ``$PATH``, which may be different in the workflow environment versus the task environment.

.. warning::
  The ``env`` scope provides environment variables to *tasks*, not Nextflow itself. Nextflow environment variables
  such as ``NXF_VER`` should be set in the environment in which Nextflow is launched.


.. _config-executor:

Scope `executor`
----------------

The ``executor`` configuration scope allows you to set the optional executor settings, listed in the following table.

===================== =====================
Name                  Description
===================== =====================
name                  The name of the executor to be used (default: ``local``).
queueSize             The number of tasks the executor will handle in a parallel manner (default: ``100``).
submitRateLimit       Determines the max rate of job submission per time unit, for example ``'10sec'`` (10 jobs per second) or ``'50/2min'`` (50 jobs every 2 minutes) (default: unlimited).
pollInterval          Determines how often to check for process termination. Default varies for each executor.
dumpInterval          Determines how often to log the executor status (default: ``5min``).
queueStatInterval     Determines how often to fetch the queue status from the scheduler (default: ``1min``). Used only by grid executors.
exitReadTimeout       Determines how long to wait before returning an error status when a process is terminated but the ``.exitcode`` file does not exist or is empty (default: ``270 sec``). Used only by grid executors.
killBatchSize         Determines the number of jobs that can be killed in a single command execution (default: ``100``).
perJobMemLimit        Specifies Platform LSF *per-job* memory limit mode. See :ref:`lsf-executor`.
perTaskReserve        Specifies Platform LSF *per-task* memory reserve mode. See :ref:`lsf-executor`.
jobName               Determines the name of jobs submitted to the underlying cluster executor e.g. ``executor.jobName = { "$task.name - $task.hash" }``. Make sure the resulting job name matches the validation constraints of the underlying batch scheduler.
cpus                  The maximum number of CPUs made available by the underlying system. Used only by the ``local`` executor.
memory                The maximum amount of memory made available by the underlying system. Used only by the ``local`` executor.
retry.delay           Delay when retrying failed job submissions (default: ``500ms``). NOTE: used only by grid executors (requires ``22.03.0-edge`` or later).
retry.maxDelay        Max delay when retrying failed job submissions (default: ``30s``). NOTE: used only by grid executors (requires ``22.03.0-edge`` or later).
retry.jitter          Jitter value when retrying failed job submissions (default: ``0.25``). NOTE: used only by grid executors (requires ``22.03.0-edge`` or later).
retry.maxAttempts     Max attempts when retrying failed job submissions (default: ``3``). NOTE: used only by grid executors (requires ``22.03.0-edge`` or later).
retry.reason          Regex pattern that when verified cause a failed submit operation to be re-tried (default: ``Socket timed out``). NOTE: used only by grid executors (requires ``22.03.0-edge`` or later).
===================== =====================

The executor settings can be defined as shown below::

    executor {
        name = 'sge'
        queueSize = 200
        pollInterval = '30 sec'
    }

When using two (or more) different executors in your pipeline, you can specify their settings separately by prefixing
the executor name with the symbol ``$`` and using it as special scope identifier. For example::

  executor {
    $sge {
        queueSize = 100
        pollInterval = '30sec'
    }

    $local {
        cpus = 8
        memory = '32 GB'
    }
  }

The above configuration example can be rewritten using the dot notation as shown below::

    executor.$sge.queueSize = 100
    executor.$sge.pollInterval = '30sec'
    executor.$local.cpus = 8
    executor.$local.memory = '32 GB'

================== ================

.. note:: Nextflow relies on the `Java Mail API <https://javaee.github.io/javamail/>`_ to send email messages.
  Advanced mail configuration can be provided by using any SMTP configuration property supported by the Java Mail API.
  See the `table of available properties at this link <https://javaee.github.io/javamail/docs/api/com/sun/mail/smtp/package-summary.html#properties>`_.

For example, the following snippet shows how to configure Nextflow to send emails through the
`AWS Simple Email Service <https://aws.amazon.com/ses/>`_::

    mail {
        smtp.host = 'email-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com'
        smtp.port = 587
        smtp.user = '<Your AWS SES access key>'
        smtp.password = '<Your AWS SES secret key>'
        smtp.auth = true
        smtp.starttls.enable = true
        smtp.starttls.required = true
    }

.. note::
  Some versions of Java (e.g. Java 11 Corretto) do not default to TLS v1.2, and as a result may have
  issues with 3rd party integrations that enforce TLS v1.2 (e.g. Azure Active Directory OIDC). This problem can be
  addressed by setting the following config option::

    mail {
        smtp.ssl.protocols = 'TLSv1.2'
    }


.. _config-manifest:

Scope `manifest`
----------------

The ``manifest`` configuration scope allows you to define some meta-data information needed when publishing your pipeline project on GitHub, BitBucket or GitLab, or when running your pipeline.

The following settings are available:

================== ================

================== ================

The above options can be used by prefixing them with the ``manifest`` scope or surrounding them by curly
brackets. For example::

    manifest {
        homePage = 'http://foo.com'
        description = 'Pipeline does this and that'
        mainScript = 'foo.nf'
        version = '1.0.0'
    }

Nextflow version
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``nextflowVersion`` setting allows you to specify a minimum required version to run the pipeline.
This may be useful to ensure that a specific version is used::

    nextflowVersion = '1.2.3'        // exact match
    nextflowVersion = '1.2+'         // 1.2 or later (excluding 2 and later)
    nextflowVersion = '>=1.2'        // 1.2 or later
    nextflowVersion = '>=1.2, <=1.5' // any version in the 1.2 .. 1.5 range
    nextflowVersion = '!>=1.2'       // with ! prefix, stop execution if current version
                                        does not match required version.


.. _config-notification:

Scope `notification`
--------------------

The ``notification`` scope allows you to define the automatic sending of a notification email message
when the workflow execution terminates.

================== ================
Name                Description
================== ================
enabled             Enables the sending of a notification message when the workflow execution completes.
to                  Recipient address for the notification email. Multiple addresses can be specified separating them with a comma.
from                Sender address for the notification email message.
template            Path of a template file which provides the content of the notification message.
binding             An associative array modelling the variables in the template file.
================== ================

The notification message is sent my using the STMP server defined in the configuration :ref:`mail scope<config-mail>`.

If no mail configuration is provided, it tries to send the notification message by using the external mail command
eventually provided by the underlying system (eg. ``sendmail`` or ``mail``).


.. _config-params:

Scope `params`
--------------

The ``params`` scope allows you to define parameters that will be accessible in the pipeline script. Simply prefix the
parameter names with the ``params`` scope or surround them by curly brackets, as shown below::

    params.custom_param = 123
    params.another_param = 'string value .. '

    params {
        alpha_1 = true
        beta_2 = 'another string ..'
    }


.. _config-podman:

Scope `podman`
--------------

The ``podman`` configuration scope controls how `Podman <https://podman.io/>`_ containers are executed by Nextflow.

The following settings are available:

================== ================
Name                Description
================== ================
enabled             Turn this flag to ``true`` to enable Podman execution (default: ``false``).
envWhitelist        Comma separated list of environment variable names to be included in the container environment.
temp                Mounts a path of your choice as the ``/tmp`` directory in the container. Use the special value ``auto`` to create a temporary directory each time a container is created.
remove              Clean-up the container after the execution (default: ``true``).
runOptions          This attribute can be used to provide any extra command line options supported by the ``podman run`` command.
registry            The registry from where container images are pulled. It should be only used to specify a private registry server. It should NOT include the protocol prefix i.e. ``http://``.
engineOptions       This attribute can be used to provide any option supported by the Podman engine i.e. ``podman [OPTIONS]``.
mountFlags          Add the specified flags to the volume mounts e.g. `mountFlags = 'ro,Z'`
================== ================

The above options can be used by prefixing them with the ``podman`` scope or surrounding them by curly
brackets, as shown below::

    process.container = 'nextflow/examples'

    podman {
        enabled = true
        temp = 'auto'
    }

Read :ref:`container-podman` page to learn more about how to use Podman containers with Nextflow.


.. _config-process:

Scope `process`
---------------

The ``process`` configuration scope allows you to provide the default configuration for the processes in your pipeline.

You can specify here any property described in the :ref:`process directive<process-directives>` and the executor sections.
For examples::

    process {
        executor = 'sge'
        queue = 'long'
        clusterOptions = '-pe smp 10 -l virtual_free=64G,h_rt=30:00:00'
    }

By using this configuration all processes in your pipeline will be executed through the SGE cluster, with the specified
settings.


.. _config-process-selectors:

Process selectors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``withLabel`` selectors allow the configuration of all processes annotated with a :ref:`process-label` directive as
shown below::

    process {
        withLabel: big_mem {
            cpus = 16
            memory = 64.GB
            queue = 'long'
        }
    }

The above configuration example assigns 16 cpus, 64 Gb of memory and the ``long`` queue to all processes annotated
with the ``big_mem`` label.

In the same manner, the ``withName`` selector allows the configuration of a specific process in your pipeline by its name.
For example::

    process {
        withName: hello {
            cpus = 4
            memory = 8.GB
            queue = 'short'
        }
    }

.. tip::
  Label and process names do not need to be enclosed with quotes, provided the name
  does not include special characters (``-``, ``!``, etc) and is not a keyword or a built-in type identifier.
  When in doubt, you can enclose the label name or process name with single or double quotes.


.. _config-selector-expressions:

Selector expressions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Both label and process name selectors allow the use of a regular expression in order to apply the same configuration
to all processes matching the specified pattern condition. For example::

    process {
        withLabel: 'foo|bar' {
            cpus = 2
            memory = 4.GB
        }
    }

The above configuration snippet sets 2 cpus and 4 GB of memory to the processes annotated with a label ``foo``
and ``bar``.

A process selector can be negated prefixing it with the special character ``!``. For example::

    process {
        withLabel: 'foo' { cpus = 2 }
        withLabel: '!foo' { cpus = 4 }
        withName: '!align.*' { queue = 'long' }
    }

The above configuration snippet sets 2 cpus for the processes annotated with the ``foo`` label and 4 cpus to all processes
*not* annotated with that label. Finally it sets the use of ``long`` queue to all process whose name does *not* start
with ``align``.


.. _config-selector-priority:

Selector priority
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When mixing generic process configuration and selectors the following priority rules are applied (from lower to higher):

1. Process generic configuration.
2. Process specific directive defined in the workflow script.
3. ``withLabel`` selector definition.
4. ``withName`` selector definition.

For example::

    process {
        cpus = 4
        withLabel: foo { cpus = 8 }
        withName: bar { cpus = 32 }
    }

Using the above configuration snippet, all workflow processes use 4 cpus if not otherwise specified in the workflow
script. Moreover processes annotated with the ``foo`` label use 8 cpus. Finally the process named ``bar``
uses 32 cpus.


.. _config-report:

Scope `report`
--------------

The ``report`` scope allows you to define configuration setting of the workflow :ref:`execution-report`.

================== ================
Name                Description
================== ================

================== ================


.. _config-sarus:

Scope `sarus`
-------------------

The ``sarus`` configuration scope controls how `Sarus <https://sarus.readthedocs.io>`_ containers are executed
by Nextflow.

The following settings are available:

================== ================
enabled             Turn this flag to ``true`` to enable Sarus execution (default: ``false``).
envWhitelist        Comma separated list of environment variable names to be included in the container environment.
tty                 Allocates a pseudo-tty (default: ``false``).
runOptions          This attribute can be used to provide any extra command line options supported by the ``sarus run`` command. For details see: https://sarus.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/user_guide.html .

noHttps             Turn this flag to ``true`` to pull the Singularity image with http protocol (default: ``false``).
autoMounts          When ``true`` Nextflow automatically mounts host paths in the executed container. It requires the `user bind control` feature enabled in your Singularity installation (default: ``false``).
cacheDir            The directory where remote Singularity images are stored. When using a computing cluster it must be a shared folder accessible to all compute nodes.
pullTimeout         The amount of time the Singularity pull can last, exceeding which the process is terminated (default: ``20 min``).
================== ================

Read :ref:`container-singularity` page to learn more about how to use Singularity containers with Nextflow.


.. _config-timeline:

Scope `timeline`
----------------

The following settings are available:

================== ================
Name                Description
================== ================
enabled            When ``true`` Nextflow sends the workflow tracing and execution metrics to the Nextflow Tower service (default: ``false``).

================== ================

The above options can be used by prefixing them with the ``tower`` scope or surrounding them by curly
brackets, as shown below::

    tower {
      enabled = true
      accessToken = '<YOUR TOKEN>'
      workspaceId = '<YOUR WORKSPACE ID>'
    }

.. tip::
  Your ``accessToken`` can be obtained from your Tower instance in the `Tokens page <https://tower.nf/tokens>`.

.. tip::
  The Tower workspace ID can also be specified using the environment variable ``TOWER_WORKSPACE_ID`` (config file has priority over the environment variable).


.. _config-trace:

raw                 When ``true`` turns on raw number report generation i.e. date and time are reported as milliseconds and memory as number of bytes
overwrite           When ``true`` overwrites any existing trace file with the same name.
================== ================

The above options can be used by prefixing them with the ``trace`` scope or surrounding them by curly
brackets. For example::

    trace {
        enabled = true
        file = 'pipeline_trace.txt'
        fields = 'task_id,name,status,exit,realtime,%cpu,rss'
    }

To learn more about the execution report that can be generated by Nextflow read :ref:`trace-report` documentation page.

url                The url where to send HTTP POST requests (default: ``http:localhost``).
================== ================


.. _config-miscellaneous:

Miscellaneous
-------------

There are additional variables that can be defined within a configuration file that do not have a dedicated scope.

These are defined alongside other scopes, but the option is assigned as typically variable.

================== ================
Name                Description
================== ================
cleanup             If ``true``, on a successful completion of a run all files in *work* directory are automatically deleted.
================== ================

.. warning::
    The use of the ``cleanup`` option will prevent the use of the *resume* feature on subsequent executions of that pipeline run.
    Also, be aware that deleting all scratch files can take a lot of time, especially when using a shared file system or remote cloud storage.


.. _config-profiles:

Config profiles
===============

Configuration files can contain the definition of one or more *profiles*. A profile is a set of configuration attributes
that can be activated/chosen when launching a pipeline execution by using the ``-profile`` command line option.

Configuration profiles are defined by using the special scope ``profiles`` which group the attributes that belong
to the same profile using a common prefix. For example::

    profiles {

        standard {
            process.executor = 'local'
        }

        cluster {
            process.executor = 'sge'
            process.queue = 'long'
            process.memory = '10GB'
        }

        cloud {
            process.executor = 'cirrus'
            process.container = 'cbcrg/imagex'
            docker.enabled = true
        }

    }

This configuration defines three different profiles: ``standard``, ``cluster`` and ``cloud`` that set different process
configuration strategies depending on the target runtime platform. By convention the ``standard`` profile is implicitly used
when no other profile is specified by the user.

.. tip::
    Multiple configuration profiles can be specified by separating the profile names
    with a comma, for example::

        nextflow run <your script> -profile standard,cloud

.. danger::
    When using the ``profiles`` feature in your config file, do NOT set attributes in the same scope both
    inside and outside a ``profiles`` context. For example::

        process.cpus = 1

        profiles {
          foo {
            process.memory = '2 GB'
          }

          bar {
            process.memory = '4 GB'
          }
        }

    In the above example, the ``process.cpus`` attribute is not correctly applied because the ``process`` scope is also
    used in the ``foo`` and ``bar`` profiles.


.. _config-env-vars:
