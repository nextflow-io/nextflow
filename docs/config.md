# Configuration

## Configuration file

When a pipeline script is launched, Nextflow looks for configuration files in multiple locations. Since each configuration file can contain conflicting settings, the sources are ranked to determine which settings are applied. Possible configuration sources, in order of priority:

1. Parameters specified on the command line (`--something value`)
2. Parameters provided using the `-params-file` option
3. Config file specified using the `-c my_config` option
4. The config file named `nextflow.config` in the current directory
5. The config file named `nextflow.config` in the workflow project directory
6. The config file `$HOME/.nextflow/config`
7. Values defined within the pipeline script itself (e.g. `main.nf`)

When more than one of these options for specifying configurations are used, they are merged, so that the settings in the first override the same settings appearing in the second, and so on.

:::{tip}
If you want to ignore any default configuration files and use only a custom one, use `-C <config file>`.
:::

### Config syntax

A Nextflow configuration file is a simple text file containing a set of properties defined using the syntax:

```groovy
name = value
```

Please note, string values need to be wrapped in quotation characters while numbers and boolean values (`true`, `false`) do not. Also note that values are typed. This means that, for example, `1` is different from `'1'` â€” the former is interpreted as the number one, while the latter is interpreted as a string value.

### Config variables

Configuration properties can be used as variables in the configuration file by using the usual `$propertyName` or `${expression}` syntax.

For example:

```groovy
propertyOne = 'world'
anotherProp = "Hello $propertyOne"
customPath = "$PATH:/my/app/folder"
```

Please note, the usual rules for {ref}`string-interpolation` are applied, thus a string containing a variable reference must be wrapped in double-quote chars instead of single-quote chars.

The same mechanism allows you to access environment variables defined in the hosting system. Any variable name not defined in the Nextflow configuration file(s) is interpreted to be a reference to an environment variable with that name. So, in the above example, the property `customPath` is defined as the current system `PATH` to which the string `/my/app/folder` is appended.

### Config comments

Configuration files use the same conventions for comments used by the Groovy or Java programming languages. Thus, use `//` to comment a single line, or `/*` .. `*/` to comment a block on multiple lines.

### Config include

A configuration file can include one or more configuration files using the keyword `includeConfig`. For example:

```groovy
process.executor = 'sge'
process.queue = 'long'
process.memory = '10G'

includeConfig 'path/foo.config'
```

When a relative path is used, it is resolved against the actual location of the including file.

## Config scopes

Configuration settings can be organized in different scopes by dot prefixing the property names with a scope identifier, or grouping the properties in the same scope using the curly brackets notation. For example:

```groovy
alpha.x = 1
alpha.y = 'string value..'

beta {
     p = 2
     q = 'another string ..'
}
```

env.BETA = "$HOME/some/path"

env {
     DELTA = 'one more'
     GAMMA = "/my/path:$PATH"
}
```

:::{note}
In the above example, variables like `$HOME` and `$PATH` are evaluated when the workflow is launched. If you want these variables to be evaluated during task execution, escape them with `\$`. This difference is important for variables like `$PATH`, which may be different in the workflow environment versus the task environment.
:::

:::{warning}
The `env` scope provides environment variables to *tasks*, not Nextflow itself. Nextflow environment variables such as `NXF_VER` should be set in the environment in which Nextflow is launched.

`executor.submitRateLimit`
: Determines the max rate of job submission per time unit, for example `'10sec'` (10 jobs per second) or `'50/2min'` (50 jobs every 2 minutes) (default: unlimited).

Some executor settings have different default values depending on the executor.

| Executor       | `queueSize` | `pollInterval` |
| -------------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| AWS Batch      | `1000`      | `10s`          |
| Azure Batch    | `1000`      | `10s`          |
| Google Batch   | `1000`      | `10s`          |
| Grid Executors | `100`       | `5s`           |
| Kubernetes     | `100`       | `5s`           |
| Local          | N/A         | `100ms`        |

The executor settings can be defined as shown below:

```groovy
executor {
    name = 'sge'
    queueSize = 200
    pollInterval = '30 sec'
}
```

When using two (or more) different executors in your pipeline, you can specify their settings separately by prefixing the executor name with the symbol `$` and using it as special scope identifier. For example:

```groovy
executor {
  $sge {
      queueSize = 100
      pollInterval = '30sec'
  }

  $local {
      cpus = 8
      memory = '32 GB'
  }
}
```

The above configuration example can be rewritten using the dot notation as shown below:

```groovy
executor.$sge.queueSize = 100
executor.$sge.pollInterval = '30sec'
executor.$local.cpus = 8
executor.$local.memory = '32 GB'
```

(config-mail)=

### Scope `mail`

The `mail` scope controls the mail server used to send email notifications.

The following settings are available:

`mail.debug`
: When `true` enables Java Mail logging for debugging purpose.

`mail.from`
: Default email sender address.

`mail.smtp.host`

For example, the following snippet shows how to configure Nextflow to send emails through the [AWS Simple Email Service](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/):

```groovy
mail {
    smtp.host = 'email-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com'
    smtp.port = 587
    smtp.user = '<Your AWS SES access key>'
    smtp.password = '<Your AWS SES secret key>'
    smtp.auth = true
    smtp.starttls.enable = true
    smtp.starttls.required = true
}
```

:::{note}
Some versions of Java (e.g. Java 11 Corretto) do not default to TLS v1.2, and as a result may have issues with 3rd party integrations that enforce TLS v1.2 (e.g. Azure Active Directory OIDC). This problem can be addressed by setting the following config option:

```groovy
mail {
    smtp.ssl.protocols = 'TLSv1.2'
}
```
:::

(config-manifest)=

### Scope `manifest`

The `manifest` scope allows you to define some meta-data information needed when publishing or running your pipeline.

The following settings are available:

`manifest.author`

: Minimum required Nextflow version.

  This setting may be useful to ensure that a specific version is used:

  ```groovy
  manifest.nextflowVersion = '1.2.3'        // exact match
  manifest.nextflowVersion = '1.2+'         // 1.2 or later (excluding 2 and later)
  manifest.nextflowVersion = '>=1.2'        // 1.2 or later
  manifest.nextflowVersion = '>=1.2, <=1.5' // any version in the 1.2 .. 1.5 range
  manifest.nextflowVersion = '!>=1.2'       // with ! prefix, stop execution if current version does not match required version.
  ```

`manifest.recurseSubmodules`
: Pull submodules recursively from the Git repository.

`manifest.version`
: Project version number.

The above options can also be specified in a `manifest` block, for example:

```groovy

    homePage = 'http://foo.com'
    description = 'Pipeline does this and that'
    mainScript = 'foo.nf'
    version = '1.0.0'
}
```

Read the {ref}`sharing-page` page to learn how to publish your pipeline to GitHub, BitBucket or GitLab.

(config-notification)=

### Scope `notification`

The `notification` scope allows you to define the automatic sending of a notification email message when the workflow execution terminates.

`notification.binding`
: An associative array modelling the variables in the template file.

`notification.enabled`
: Enables the sending of a notification message when the workflow execution completes.

`notification.from`
: Sender address for the notification email message.

`notification.template`
: Path of a template file which provides the content of the notification message.

`notification.to`
: Recipient address for the notification email. Multiple addresses can be specified separating them with a comma.

The notification message is sent my using the STMP server defined in the configuration {ref}`mail scope<config-mail>`.

If no mail configuration is provided, it tries to send the notification message by using the external mail command eventually provided by the underlying system (e.g. `sendmail` or `mail`).

(config-params)=

### Scope `params`

The `params` scope allows you to define parameters that will be accessible in the pipeline script. Simply prefix the parameter names with the `params` scope or surround them by curly brackets, as shown below:

```groovy
params.custom_param = 123
params.another_param = 'string value .. '

params {
    alpha_1 = true
    beta_2 = 'another string ..'
}
```

(config-podman)=

### Scope `podman`

The `podman` scope controls how [Podman](https://podman.io/) containers are executed by Nextflow.

The following settings are available:

`podman.enabled`
: Enable Podman execution (default: `false`).

`podman.engineOptions`
: This attribute can be used to provide any option supported by the Podman engine i.e. `podman [OPTIONS]`.

`podman.envWhitelist`
: Comma separated list of environment variable names to be included in the container environment.

`podman.mountFlags`
: Add the specified flags to the volume mounts e.g. `mountFlags = 'ro,Z'`.

`podman.registry`
: The registry from where container images are pulled. It should be only used to specify a private registry server. It should NOT include the protocol prefix i.e. `http://`.

`podman.remove`
: Clean-up the container after the execution (default: `true`).

`podman.runOptions`
: This attribute can be used to provide any extra command line options supported by the `podman run` command.

`podman.temp`
: Mounts a path of your choice as the `/tmp` directory in the container. Use the special value `auto` to create a temporary directory each time a container is created.

Read the {ref}`container-podman` page to learn more about how to use Podman containers with Nextflow.

(config-process)=

### Scope `process`

The `process` scope allows you to specify default {ref}`directives <process-directives>` for processes in your pipeline.

For example:

```groovy
process {
    executor = 'sge'
    queue = 'long'
    clusterOptions = '-pe smp 10 -l virtual_free=64G,h_rt=30:00:00'
}
```

By using this configuration, all processes in your pipeline will be executed through the SGE cluster, with the specified settings.

(config-process-selectors)=

#### Process selectors

The `withLabel` selectors allow the configuration of all processes annotated with a {ref}`process-label` directive as shown below:

```groovy
process {
    withLabel: big_mem {
        cpus = 16
        memory = 64.GB
        queue = 'long'
    }
}
```

The above configuration example assigns 16 cpus, 64 Gb of memory and the `long` queue to all processes annotated with the `big_mem` label.

In the same manner, the `withName` selector allows the configuration of a specific process in your pipeline by its name. For example:

```groovy
process {
    withName: hello {
        cpus = 4
        memory = 8.GB
        queue = 'short'
    }
}
```

:::{tip}
Label and process names do not need to be enclosed with quotes, provided the name does not include special characters (`-`, `!`, etc) and is not a keyword or a built-in type identifier. When in doubt, you can enclose the label name or process name with single or double quotes.
:::

(config-selector-expressions)=

#### Selector expressions

Both label and process name selectors allow the use of a regular expression in order to apply the same configuration to all processes matching the specified pattern condition. For example:

```groovy
process {
    withLabel: 'foo|bar' {
        cpus = 2
        memory = 4.GB
    }
}
```

The above configuration snippet sets 2 cpus and 4 GB of memory to the processes annotated with a label `foo` and `bar`.

A process selector can be negated prefixing it with the special character `!`. For example:

```groovy
process {
    withLabel: 'foo' { cpus = 2 }
    withLabel: '!foo' { cpus = 4 }
    withName: '!align.*' { queue = 'long' }
}
```

The above configuration snippet sets 2 cpus for the processes annotated with the `foo` label and 4 cpus to all processes *not* annotated with that label. Finally it sets the use of `long` queue to all process whose name does *not* start with `align`.

(config-selector-priority)=

#### Selector priority

When mixing generic process configuration and selectors the following priority rules are applied (from lower to higher):

1. Process generic configuration.
2. Process specific directive defined in the workflow script.
3. `withLabel` selector definition.
4. `withName` selector definition.

For example:

```groovy
process {
    cpus = 4
    withLabel: foo { cpus = 8 }
    withName: bar { cpus = 32 }
}
```

Using the above configuration snippet, all workflow processes use 4 cpus if not otherwise specified in the workflow script. Moreover processes annotated with the `foo` label use 8 cpus. Finally the process named `bar` uses 32 cpus.

(config-report)=

### Scope `report`

The `report` scope allows you to configure the workflow {ref}`execution-report`.

The following settings are available:

`report.enabled`
: If `true` it create the workflow execution report.

Read the {ref}`container-shifter` page to learn more about how to use Shifter containers with Nextflow.

(config-singularity)=

### Scope `singularity`

The `singularity` scope controls how [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/singularity/) containers are executed by Nextflow.

The following settings are available:

`singularity.autoMounts`
: When `true` Nextflow automatically mounts host paths in the executed container. It requires the `user bind control` feature to be enabled in your Singularity installation (default: `false`).

`singularity.cacheDir`
: The directory where remote Singularity images are stored. When using a computing cluster it must be a shared folder accessible to all compute nodes.

`singularity.enabled`

`singularity.registry`
: :::{versionadded} 22.12.0-edge
  :::
: The registry from where Docker images are pulled. It should be only used to specify a private registry server. It should NOT include the protocol prefix i.e. `http://`.

`singularity.runOptions`
: This attribute can be used to provide any extra command line options supported by `singularity exec`.

Read the {ref}`container-singularity` page to learn more about how to use Singularity containers with Nextflow.

(config-spack)=

### Scope `spack`

The `spack` scope controls the creation of a Spack environment by the Spack package manager.

The following settings are available:

`spack.cacheDir`
: Defines the path where Spack environments are stored. When using a compute cluster make sure to provide a shared file system path accessible from all compute nodes.

`spack.checksum`
: Enables checksum verification for source tarballs (default: `true`). Only disable when requesting a package version not yet encoded in the corresponding Spack recipe.

`spack.createTimeout`
: Defines the amount of time the Spack environment creation can last. The creation process is terminated when the timeout is exceeded (default: `60 min`).

`spack.parallelBuilds`
: Sets number of parallel package builds (Spack default: coincides with number of available CPU cores).

Nextflow does not allow for fine-grained configuration of the Spack package manager. Instead, this has to be performed directly on the host Spack installation. For more information see the [Spack documentation](https://spack.readthedocs.io).

(config-timeline)=

### Scope `timeline`

The `timeline` scope controls the execution timeline report generated by Nextflow.

The following settings are available:

`timeline.enabled`
: When `true` enables the generation of the timeline report file (default: `false`).

`timeline.file`
: Timeline file name (default: `timeline-<timestamp>.html`).

`timeline.overwrite`
: When `true` overwrites any existing timeline file with the same name.

(config-tower)=

### Scope `tower`

The `tower` scope controls the settings for the [Nextflow Tower](https://tower.nf) monitoring and tracing service.

The following settings are available:

`tower.accessToken`
: The unique access token specific to your account on an instance of Tower.

  Your `accessToken` can be obtained from your Tower instance in the [Tokens page](https://tower.nf/tokens).

`tower.enabled`
: When `true` Nextflow sends the workflow tracing and execution metrics to the Nextflow Tower service (default: `false`).

(config-trace)=

### Scope `trace`

The `trace` scope controls the layout of the execution trace file generated by Nextflow.

The following settings are available:

`trace.enabled`
: When `true` turns on the generation of the execution trace report file (default: `false`).

`trace.fields`
: Comma separated list of fields to be included in the report. The available fields are listed at {ref}`this page <trace-fields>`.

`trace.file`
: Trace file name (default: `trace-<timestamp>.txt`).

    enabled = true
    file = 'pipeline_trace.txt'
    fields = 'task_id,name,status,exit,realtime,%cpu,rss'
}
```

Read the {ref}`trace-report` page to learn more about the execution report that can be generated by Nextflow.

(config-weblog)=

### Scope `weblog`

The `weblog` scope allows you to send detailed {ref}`trace <trace-fields>` information as HTTP POST requests to a webserver, shipped as a JSON object.

Detailed information about the JSON fields can be found in the {ref}`weblog description<weblog-service>`.

`weblog.enabled`
: If `true` it will send HTTP POST requests to a given url.

`weblog.url`
: The url where to send HTTP POST requests (default: `http:localhost`).

(config-miscellaneous)=

### Miscellaneous

There are additional variables that can be defined within a configuration file that do not have a dedicated scope.

`cleanup`
: If `true`, on a successful completion of a run all files in *work* directory are automatically deleted.

  :::{warning}
  The use of the `cleanup` option will prevent the use of the *resume* feature on subsequent executions of that pipeline run. Also, be aware that deleting all scratch files can take a lot of time, especially when using a shared file system or remote cloud storage.
  :::

`dumpHashes`
: If `true`, dump task hash keys in the log file, for debugging purposes.

(config-profiles)=

## Config profiles

Configuration files can contain the definition of one or more *profiles*. A profile is a set of configuration attributes that can be selected during pipeline execution by using the `-profile` command line option.

Configuration profiles are defined by using the special scope `profiles`, which group the attributes that belong to the same profile using a common prefix. For example:

```groovy
profiles {

    standard {
        process.executor = 'local'
    }

    cluster {
        process.executor = 'sge'
        process.queue = 'long'
        process.memory = '10GB'
    }

    cloud {
        process.executor = 'cirrus'
        process.container = 'cbcrg/imagex'
        docker.enabled = true
    }

}
```

This configuration defines three different profiles: `standard`, `cluster`, and `cloud`, that each set different process
configuration strategies depending on the target runtime platform. The `standard` profile is used by default when no profile is specified.

:::{tip}
Multiple configuration profiles can be specified by separating the profile names with a comma, for example:

```bash
nextflow run <your script> -profile standard,cloud
```
:::

:::{danger}
When using the `profiles` feature in your config file, do NOT set attributes in the same scope both inside and outside a `profiles` context. For example:

```groovy
process.cpus = 1

profiles {
  foo {
    process.memory = '2 GB'
  }

  bar {
    process.memory = '4 GB'
  }
}
```

In the above example, the `process.cpus` attribute is not correctly applied because the `process` scope is also used in the `foo` and `bar` profiles.
:::

(config-env-vars)=

## Environment variables

The following environment variables control the configuration of the Nextflow runtime and the underlying Java virtual machine.

`NXF_ANSI_LOG`
: Enables/disables ANSI console output (default `true` when ANSI terminal is detected).

`NXF_ANSI_SUMMARY`

(config-feature-flags)=

## Feature flags

Some features can be enabled using the `nextflow.enable` and `nextflow.preview` flags. These flags can be specified in the pipeline script or the configuration file, and they are generally used to introduce experimental or other opt-in features.

`nextflow.enable.configProcessNamesValidation`

: When `true`, prints a warning for every `withName:` process selector that doesn't match a process in the pipeline (default: `true`).

`nextflow.enable.dsl`

: Defines the DSL version to use (`1` or `2`).

: :::{versionadded} 22.03.0-edge
  DSL2 is the default DSL version.
  :::

: :::{versionadded} 22.12.0-edge
  DSL1 is no longer supported.
  :::

`nextflow.enable.moduleBinaries`

: When `true`, enables the use of modules with binary scripts. See {ref}`module-binaries` for more information.

`nextflow.enable.strict`

: :::{versionadded} 22.05.0-edge
  :::

: When `true`, the pipeline is executed in "strict" mode, which introduces the following rules:

  - When reading a params file, Nextflow will fail if a dynamic param value references an undefined variable

  - When merging params from a config file with params from the command line, Nextflow will fail if a param is specified from both sources but with different types

  - When using the `join` operator, the `failOnDuplicate` option is `true` by default

  - When using the `join` operator, the `failOnMismatch` option is `true` by default (unless `remainder` is also `true`)

  - When using the `publishDir` process directive, the `failOnError` option is `true` by default

  - In a process definition, Nextflow will fail if an input or output tuple has only one element

  - In a process definition, Nextflow will fail if an output emit name is not a valid identifier (i.e. it should match the pattern `/[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*/`)

  - During a process execution, Nextflow will fail if a received input tuple does not have the same number of elements as was declared

  - During a process execution, Nextflow will fail if the `storeDir` directive is used with non-file outputs

  - Nextflow will fail if a pipeline param is referenced before it is defined

  - Nextflow will fail if multiple functions and/or processes with the same name are defined in a module script

`nextflow.preview.recursion`

: :::{versionadded} 21.11.0-edge
  :::

: *Experimental: may change in a future release.*

: When `true`, enables process and workflow recursion. See [this GitHub discussion](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow/discussions/2521) for more information.
