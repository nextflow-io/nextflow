******
DSL 2
******

Nextflow provides a syntax extension that allows the definition of module libraries and
simplifies the writing of complex data analysis pipelines.

To enable this feature you need to define the following directive at the beginning of
your workflow script::

    nextflow.enable.dsl=2

.. tip::
  As of version ``22.03.0-edge`` Nextflow defaults to DSL 2 if no version is specified explicitly.
  You can restore the previous behavior setting in into your environment the following variable::

    export NXF_DEFAULT_DSL=1

.. note::
  As of version ``22.03.0-edge`` the DSL version specification (either 1 or 2) can also be specified in
  the Nextflow configuration file using the same notation shown above.

Function
========

Nextflow allows the definition of custom functions in the workflow script using the following syntax::

    def <function name> ( arg1, arg, .. ) {
        <function body>
    }

For example::

    def foo() {
        'Hello world'
    }

    def bar(alpha, omega) {
        alpha + omega
    }


The above snippet defines two simple functions, that can be invoked in the workflow script as ``foo()`` which
returns the ``Hello world`` string and ``bar(10,20)`` which returns the sum of two parameters (``30`` in this case).

.. note:: Functions implicitly return the result of the last evaluated statement.

The keyword ``return`` can be used to explicitly exit from a function and return the specified value.
For example::

    def fib( x ) {
        if( x <= 1 )
            return x
        else
            fib(x-1) + fib(x-2)
    }


Process
=======

Process definition
------------------

The new DSL separates the definition of a process from its invocation. The process definition follows the usual
syntax as described in the :ref:`process documentation <process-page>`. The only difference is that the
``from`` and ``into`` channel declarations have to be omitted.

Then a process can be invoked as a function in the ``workflow`` scope, passing the expected
input channels as parameters as if it were a custom function. For example::

    nextflow.enable.dsl=2

    process foo {
        output:
          path 'foo.txt'

        script:
          """
          your_command > foo.txt
          """
    }

    process bar {
        input:
          path x

        output:
          path 'bar.txt'

        script:
          """
          another_command $x > bar.txt
          """
    }

    workflow {
        data = channel.fromPath('/some/path/*.txt')
        foo()
        bar(data)
    }

.. warning::
  A process component can be invoked only once in the same workflow context.


Process composition
-------------------

Processes having matching *input-output* declaration can be composed so that the output
of the first process is passed as input to the next process. Taking in consideration
the previous example, it's possible to write the following::

    workflow {
        bar(foo())
    }


Process output
---------------

A process output can also be accessed using the ``out`` attribute on the corresponding
process object. For example::

    workflow {
        foo()
        bar(foo.out)
        bar.out.view()
    }

When a process defines two or more output channels, each of them can be accessed
using the array element operator e.g. ``out[0]``, ``out[1]``, etc. or using
*named outputs* (see below).


Process named output
--------------------

The ``emit`` option can be added to the process output definition to assign a name identifier. This name
can be used to reference the channel within the caller scope. For example::

    process foo {
      output:
        path '*.bam', emit: samples_bam

      '''
      your_command --here
      '''
    }

    workflow {
        foo()
        foo.out.samples_bam.view()
    }


Process named stdout
--------------------

The ``emit`` option can be used also to name the stdout::

    process sayHello {
        input:
            val cheers

        output:
            stdout emit: verbiage

        script:
        """
        echo -n $cheers
        """
    }

    workflow {
        things = channel.of('Hello world!', 'Yo, dude!', 'Duck!')
        sayHello(things)
        sayHello.out.verbiage.view()
    }


Workflow
========

Workflow definition
--------------------

The ``workflow`` keyword allows the definition of sub-workflow components that enclose the
invocation of one or more processes and operators::

    workflow my_pipeline {
        foo()
        bar( foo.out.collect() )
    }

For example, the above snippet defines a workflow component, named ``my_pipeline``, that can be invoked from
another workflow component definition as any other function or process with ``my_pipeline()``.


Workflow parameters
---------------------

A workflow component can access any variable and parameter defined in the outer scope::

    params.data = '/some/data/file'

    workflow my_pipeline {
        if( params.data )
            bar(params.data)
        else
            bar(foo())
    }


Workflow input
---------------

A workflow component can declare one or more input channels using the ``take`` keyword. For example::

    workflow my_pipeline {
        take: data
        main:
            foo(data)
            bar(foo.out)
    }

.. warning::
  When the ``take`` keyword is used, the beginning of the workflow body must be identified with the
  ``main`` keyword.

Then, the input can be specified as an argument in the workflow invocation statement::

    workflow {
        my_pipeline( channel.from('/some/data') )
    }

.. note::
  Workflow inputs are always channels by definition. If a basic data type is provided instead,
  such as a number, string, list, etc, it is implicitly converted to a :ref:`value channel <channel-type-value>`.


Workflow output
----------------

A workflow component can declare one or more output channels using the ``emit`` keyword. For example::

    workflow my_pipeline {
        main:
          foo(data)
          bar(foo.out)
        emit:
          bar.out
    }

Then, the result of the ``my_pipeline`` execution can be accessed using the ``out`` property, i.e.
``my_pipeline.out``. When multiple output channels are declared, use the array bracket notation
to access each output channel as described for the `Process output`_ definition.


Workflow named output
---------------------
If the output channel is assigned to an identifier in the ``emit`` declaration, such identifier can be used
to reference the channel within the caller scope. For example::

     workflow my_pipeline {
        main:
          foo(data)
          bar(foo.out)
        emit:
          my_data = bar.out
     }

Then, the result of the above snippet can accessed using ``my_pipeline.out.my_data``.


Workflow entrypoint
-------------------

A workflow definition which does not declare any name (also known as *implicit workflow*) is
the entry point of execution for the workflow application.

.. note::
  Implicit workflow definition is ignored when a script is included as a module. This
  allows the writing of a workflow script that can be used either as a library module or as
  an application script.

.. tip::
  A different workflow entrypoint can be specified using the ``-entry`` command line option.


Workflow composition
--------------------

Workflows defined in your script or imported with `Module inclusion`_ can be invoked and composed
as any other process in your application.

::

    workflow flow1 {
        take: data
        main:
            foo(data)
            bar(foo.out)
        emit:
            bar.out
    }

    workflow flow2 {
        take: data
        main:
            foo(data)
            baz(foo.out)
        emit:
            baz.out
    }

    workflow {
        take: data
        main:
            flow1(data)
            flow2(flow1.out)
    }

.. note::
    Nested workflow execution determines an implicit scope. Therefore the same process can be
    invoked in two different workflow scopes, like for example ``foo`` in the above snippet that
    is used both in ``flow1`` and ``flow2``. The workflow execution path, along with the
    process names, determines the *fully qualified process name* that is used to distinguish the
    two different process invocations, i.e. ``flow1:foo`` and ``flow2:foo`` in the above example.

.. tip::
    The fully qualified process name can be used as a valid :ref:`process selector <config-process-selectors>` in the
    ``nextflow.config`` file and it has priority over the simple process name.


Modules
=======

The new DSL allows the definition of *module scripts* that
can be included and shared across workflow applications.

A module script (or simply, module) can contain the definition of functions, processes and workflows
as described in the previous sections.

.. note::
    Functions, processes and workflows are globally referred to as *components*.


Module inclusion
----------------

A component defined in a module script can be imported into another Nextflow script using the ``include`` keyword.

For example::

    include { foo } from './some/module'

    workflow {
        data = channel.fromPath('/some/data/*.txt')
        foo(data)
    }

The above snippet includes a process with name ``foo`` defined in the module script in the main
execution context. This way, `foo`` can be invoked in the ``workflow`` scope.

Nextflow implicitly looks for the script file ``./some/module.nf`` resolving the path
against the *including* script location.

.. note::
    Relative paths must begin with the ``./`` prefix. Also, the ``include`` statement must be defined **outside** of the workflow definition.

.. _dsl2-module-directory:

Module directory
----------------

As of version ``22.10.0``, the module can be defined as a directory whose name matches the module name and
contains a script named ``main.nf``. For example::

    some
        └-module
            └-main.nf

When defined as a directory the module needs to be included specifying the module directory path::

    include { foo } from './some/module'

Module directories allows the use of module scoped binaries scripts. See `Module binaries`_ for details.

Multiple inclusions
-------------------

A Nextflow script allows the inclusion of an arbitrary number of modules and components. When multiple
components need to be included from the same module script, the component names can be
specified in the same inclusion using the curly brackets notation as shown below::

    include { foo; bar } from './some/module'

    workflow {
        data = channel.fromPath('/some/data/*.txt')
        foo(data)
        bar(data)
    }


Module aliases
--------------

When including a module component, it's possible to specify an *alias* with the ``as`` keyword.
This allows the inclusion and the invocation of components with the same name
in your script using different names. For example::

    include { foo } from './some/module'
    include { foo as bar } from './other/module'

    workflow {
        foo(some_data)
        bar(other_data)
    }

The same is possible when including the same component multiple times from the same module script as shown below::

    include { foo; foo as bar } from './some/module'

    workflow {
        foo(some_data)
        bar(other_data)
    }


Module parameters
-----------------

A module script can define one or more parameters using the same syntax of a Nextflow workflow script::

    params.foo = 'Hello'
    params.bar = 'world!'

    def sayHello() {
        println "$params.foo $params.bar"
    }


Then, parameters are inherited from the including context. For example::

    params.foo = 'Hola'
    params.bar = 'Mundo'

    include {sayHello} from './some/module'

    workflow {
        sayHello()
    }

The above snippet prints::

    Hola Mundo

.. note::
  The module inherits the parameters defined *before* the ``include`` statement, therefore any further
  parameter set later is ignored.

.. tip::
  Define all pipeline parameters at the beginning of the script *before* any ``include`` declaration.

The option ``addParams`` can be used to extend the module parameters without affecting the external
scope. For example::

    include {sayHello} from './some/module' addParams(foo: 'Ciao')

    workflow {
        sayHello()
    }

The above snippet prints::

    Ciao world!

Finally, the include option ``params`` allows the specification of one or more parameters without
inheriting any value from the external environment.


.. _module-templates:

Module templates
-----------------

The module script can be defined in an external :ref:`template <process-template>` file. With DSL2 the template file
can be placed under the ``templates`` directory where the module script is located.

For example, let's suppose to have a project L with a module script defining 2 processes (P1 and P2) and both use templates.
The template files can be made available under the local ``templates`` directory::

    Project L
        |─myModules.nf
        └─templates
            |─P1-template.sh
            └─P2-template.sh

Then, we have a second project A with a workflow that includes P1 and P2::

    Pipeline A
        └-main.nf

Finally, we have a third project B with a workflow that includes again P1 and P2::

    Pipeline B
        └-main.nf

With the possibility to keep the template files inside the project L, A and B can use the modules defined in L without any changes.
A future project C would do the same, just cloning L (if not available on the system) and including its module script.

Beside promoting sharing modules across pipelines, there are several advantages in keeping the module template under the script path:

1. module components are *self-contained*,
2. module components can be tested independently from the pipeline(s) importing them,
3. it is possible to create libraries of module components.

Ultimately, having multiple template locations allows a more structured organization within the same project. If a project
has several module components, and all them use templates, the project could group module scripts and their templates as needed. For example::

    baseDir
        |─main.nf
        └─Phase0-Modules
            |─mymodules1.nf
            |─mymodules2.nf
            └─templates
                |─P1-template.sh
                |─P2-template.sh
        └─Phase1-Modules
            |─mymodules3.nf
            |─mymodules4.nf
            └─templates
                |─P3-template.sh
                └─P4-template.sh
        └─Phase2-Modules
            |─mymodules5.nf
            |─mymodules6.nf
            └─templates
                |─P5-template.sh
                |─P6-template.sh
                └─P7-template.sh

Module binaries
-----------------

As of version ``22.10.0``, modules can define binary scripts that are locally scoped to the processes defined by the tasks.

To enable this feature add the following setting in pipeline configuration file::

    nextflow.enable.moduleBinaries = true

The binary scripts must be placed in the module directory names ``<module-dir>/resources/usr/bin``::

    <module-dir>
        |─main.nf
        └─resources
            └─usr
                └─bin
                    |─your-module-script1.sh
                    └─another-module-script2.py

Those scripts will be accessible as any other command in the tasks environment, provided they have been granted
the Linux execute permissions.

.. note::
    This feature requires the use of a local or shared file system as the pipeline work directory.

Channel forking
===============

Using the new DSL, Nextflow channels are automatically forked when connecting two or more consumers.

For example::

    channel
        .from('Hello','Hola','Ciao')
        .set{ cheers }

    cheers
        .map{ it.toUpperCase() }
        .view()

    cheers
        .map{ it.reverse() }
        .view()

The same is valid for the result (channel) of a process execution. Therefore a process output can be consumed by
two or more processes without the need to fork it using the :ref:`operator-into` operator, making the
writing of workflow scripts more fluent and readable.


Pipes
=====

The *pipe* operator
-------------------

Nextflow processes and operators can be composed using the ``|`` *pipe* operator. For example::

    process foo {
        input:
        val data

        output:
        val result

        exec:
        result = "$data world"
    }

    workflow {
       channel.from('Hello','Hola','Ciao') | foo | map { it.toUpperCase() } | view
    }

The above snippet defines a process named ``foo`` and invokes it passing the content of the
``data`` channel. The result is then piped to the :ref:`operator-map` operator which converts each string
to uppercase and finally, the last :ref:`operator-view` operator prints it.


The *and* operator
------------------

The ``&`` *and* operator allows feeding of two or more processes with the content of the same
channel(s). For example::

    process foo {
        input:
        val data

        output:
        val result

        exec:
        result = "$data world"
    }

    process bar {
        input:
        val data

        output:
        val result

        exec:
        result = data.toUpperCase()
    }

    workflow {
        channel.from('Hello') | map { it.reverse() } | (foo & bar) | mix | view
    }

In the above snippet the channel emitting the ``Hello`` string is piped with the :ref:`operator-map`
which reverses the string value. Then, the result is passed to both ``foo`` and ``bar``
processes which are executed in parallel. Each process outputs a channel, and the two channels are merged
into a single channel using the :ref:`operator-mix` operator. Finally the result is printed
using the :ref:`operator-view` operator.

.. tip::
  The break-line operator ``\`` can be used to split long statements over multiple lines.
  The above snippet can also be written as::

    workflow {
        channel.from('Hello') \
          | map { it.reverse() } \
          | (foo & bar) \
          | mix \
          | view
    }


DSL2 migration notes
=====================

* DSL2 final version is activated using the declaration ``nextflow.enable.dsl=2`` in place of ``nextflow.preview.dsl=2``.
* Process inputs of type ``set`` have to be replaced with :ref:`tuple <process-input-tuple>`.
* Process outputs of type ``set`` have to be replaced with :ref:`tuple <process-out-tuple>`.
* Process output option ``mode flatten`` is no longer available. Replace it using the :ref:`operator-flatten` operator on the corresponding output channel.
* Anonymous and unwrapped includes are not supported anymore. Replace them with an explicit module inclusion. For example::

        include './some/library'
        include bar from './other/library'

        workflow {
          foo()
          bar()
        }

  Should be replaced with::

        include { foo } from './some/library'
        include { bar } from './other/library'

        workflow {
          foo()
          bar()
        }

* The use of unqualified value and file elements into input tuples is not allowed anymore. Replace them with a corresponding
  ``val`` or ``path`` qualifier::

        process foo {
        input:
          tuple X, 'some-file.bam'

        script:
          '''
          your_command --in $X some-file.bam
          '''
        }

  Use::

        process foo {
        input:
          tuple val(X), path('some-file.bam')

        script:
          '''
          your_command --in $X some-file.bam
          '''
        }

* The use of unqualified value and file elements into output tuples is not allowed anymore. Replace them with a corresponding
  ``val`` or ``path`` qualifier::

        process foo {
        output:
          tuple X, 'some-file.bam'

        script:
          X = 'some value'
          '''
          your_command > some-file.bam
          '''
        }

  Use::

        process foo {
        output:
          tuple val(X), path('some-file.bam')

        script:
          X = 'some value'
          '''
          your_command > some-file.bam
          '''
        }
