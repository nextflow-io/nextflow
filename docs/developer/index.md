# Overview

This section is intended to explain the Nextflow source code at a high level for users who want to understand or contribute to it. Rather than a comprehensive API documentation, these docs simply provide a conceptual map to help you understand the key concepts of the Nextflow implementation, and to quickly find code sections of interest for further investigation.

## Programming Languages

Nextflow is written in [Groovy](http://groovy-lang.org/), which is itself a programming language based on [Java](https://www.java.com/). Groovy is designed to be highly interoperable with Java -- Groovy programs compile to Java bytecode, and nearly any Java program is also a valid Groovy program. However, Groovy adds several language features (e.g. closures, list and map literals, optional typing, optional semicolons, meta-programming) and standard libraries (e.g. JSON and XML parsing) that greatly improve the overall experience of developing for the Java virtual machine.

Recommended resources for Groovy, from most reference-complete to most user-friendly, are listed below:

- [Groovy documentation](http://groovy-lang.org/documentation.html)
- [Groovy in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/groovy-in-action-second-edition)
- [Groovy: The Awesome Parts](https://www.slideshare.net/paulk_asert/awesome-groovy)
- [Groovy cheat sheet](http://www.cheat-sheets.org/saved-copy/rc015-groovy_online.pdf)

## Software Dependencies

Nextflow depends on a variety of libraries and frameworks, the most prominent of which are listed below:

- [AWS SDK for Java 1.x](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/): AWS integration
- [Azure SDK for Java](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/java/sdk/): Azure integration
- [Google Cloud Client Libraries for Java](https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/reference): Google Cloud integration
- [GPars](http://gpars.org/1.2.1/guide/guide/dataflow.html): dataflow concurrency
- [Gradle](https://gradle.org/): build automation
- [JCommander](https://jcommander.org/): command line interface
- [JGit](https://www.eclipse.org/jgit/): Git integration
- [Kryo](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/kryo): serialization
- [LevelDB](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.iq80.leveldb/leveldb): key-value store for the cache database
- [Logback](https://logback.qos.ch/): application logging
- [PF4J](https://pf4j.org/): plugin extensions
- [Spock](https://spockframework.org/): unit testing framework

Any other integrations are likely implemented using a CLI (e.g. Conda, Docker, HPC schedulers) or REST API (e.g. Kubernetes).

## Class Diagrams

Each package has a class diagram, abridged and annotated for relevance and ease of use.

Each node is a class. Fields are selectively documented in order to show only the core data structures and the classes that "own" them. Methods are not explicitly documented, but they are mentioned in certain links where appropriate. Links are selectively documented in order to show only the most important classes and relationships.

Links between classes denote one of the following relationships:

- Inheritance (`A <|-- B`): `B` is a subclass of `A`
- Composition (`A --* B`): `A` contains `B`
- Instantiation (`A --> B : f`): `A` creates instance(s) of `B` at runtime via `A::f()`

See {ref}`packages-page` for the list of Nextflow packages.

```{warning}
Class diagrams are manually curated, so they might not always reflect the latest version of the source code.
```

## Building and Testing

The only dependency that you need to build Nextflow is Java. In other words, if you can run Nextflow, then you can probably build it too!

Build and test locally from a branch (useful for testing PRs):

```bash
# build
git clone -b <branch> git@github.com:nextflow-io/nextflow.git
cd nextflow
make compile

# test
./launch.sh run <script> ...
```

Run tests locally:

```bash
# run all tests
make test

# run individual test
make test module=<nextflow|plugins:nf-amazon|...> class=<package>.<class>

# view the Makefile for all build rules
```

When a test fails, it will give you a report that you can open in your browser to view the stack trace for each failed test. The "Standard output" tab is particularly useful as it shows the console output of each test. You also can view this console output in the terminal by adding `--info` to the `./gradlew` command generated by the Makefile.

## Installing from source

The `nextflow` command is just a Bash script that downloads and executes the Nextflow JAR. When you install Nextflow using `get.nextflow.io`, it only downloads this launcher script, while the Nextflow JAR is downloaded on the first Nextflow run.

You can run `make install` to install a local build of the Nextflow JAR to `$NXF_HOME`. Note that it will overwrite any existing JAR with the same version. This approach is useful for testing non-core plugins with a local build of Nextflow.

If you need to test changes to the `nextflow` launcher script, you can run it directly as `./nextflow`, or you can install it using `cp nextflow $(which nextflow)` and then run it as `nextflow`.

## Debugging

The `groovysh` command provides a command-line REPL that you can use to play around with Groovy code independently of Nextflow. The `groovyConsole` command provides a graphical REPL similar to `nextflow console`. These commands require a standalone Groovy distribution, which can be installed as described for Java in {ref}`Getting started <getstarted-requirement>`.

:::{note}
If you are using WSL, you must also install an X server for Windows, such as [VcXsrv](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/) or [Xming](http://www.straightrunning.com/XmingNotes/), in order to use these commands.
