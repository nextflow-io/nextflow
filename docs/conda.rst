Conda environments
******************

`Conda <https://conda.io/>`_ is an open source package and environment management
system that simplifies the installation and the configuration of complex software packages
in a platform agnostic manner.

Nextflow has built-in support for Conda that allows the configuration of workflow dependencies
using Conda recipes and environment files.

This allows Nextflow applications to use popular tool collections
such as `Bioconda <https://bioconda.github.io>`_ whilst taking advantage of the configuration
flexibility provided by Nextflow.

Prerequisites
-------------

This feature requires Nextflow version 0.30.x or higher and the Conda or
`Miniconda <https://conda.io/miniconda.html>`_ package manager installed on your system.

How it works
------------

Nextflow  automatically creates and activates the Conda environment(s) given the dependencies
specified by each process.

Dependencies are specified by using the :ref:`process-conda` directive, providing either
the names of the required Conda packages, the path of a Conda environment yaml file or
the path of an existing Conda environment directory.

.. note:: Conda environments are stored on the file system. By default Nextflow instructs Conda to save
  the required environments in the pipeline work directory. Therefore the same environment can be created/saved
  multiple times across multiple executions when using a different work directory.

You can specify the directory where the Conda environments are stored using the ``conda.cacheDir``
configuration property (see the :ref:`configuration page <config-conda>` for details).
When using a computing cluster, make sure to use a shared file system path
accessible from all computing nodes.

.. warning:: The Conda environment feature is not supported by executors which use
  a remote object storage as a work directory eg. AWS Batch.

Use Mamba to resolve packages
=======================

It is also possible to use `mamba <https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba>`_ for speeding up creation of conda environments. For more information on how to enable this feature please refer :ref:`Conda <config-conda>`.

.. warning:: The use of ``mamba`` to create conda environments is an experimental feature and the functionality may change in future releases.


Use Conda package names
=======================

Conda package names can specified using the ``conda`` directive. Multiple package names can be specified
by separating them with a blank space.
For example::

  process foo {
    conda 'bwa samtools multiqc'

    '''
    your_command --here
    '''
  }


Using the above definition a Conda environment that includes BWA, Samtools and MultiQC tools is created and
activated when the process is executed.

The usual Conda package syntax and naming conventions can be used. The version of a package can be
specified after the package name as shown here ``bwa=0.7.15``.

The name of the channel where a package is located can be specified prefixing the package with
the channel name as shown here ``bioconda::bwa=0.7.15``.


Use Conda environment files
===========================

Conda environments can also be defined using one or more Conda environment files. This is a file that
lists the required packages and channels structured using the YAML format. For example::

    name: my-env
    channels:
      - conda-forge
      - bioconda
      - defaults
    dependencies:
      - star=2.5.4a
      - bwa=0.7.15

Read the Conda documentation for more details about how to create `environment files <https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-file-manually>`_.

The path of an environment file can be specified using the ``conda`` directive::

  process foo {
    conda '/some/path/my-env.yaml'

    '''
    your_command --here
    '''
  }

.. warning:: The environment file name **must** end with a ``.yml`` or ``.yaml`` suffix otherwise 
  it won't be properly recognised.


Alternatively it is also possible to provide the dependencies using a plain text file,
just listing each package name as a separate line. For example::

      bioconda::star=2.5.4a
      bioconda::bwa=0.7.15
      bioconda::multiqc=1.4


.. note:: Like before the extension matter, make sure such file ends with the ``.txt`` extension.


Use existing Conda environments
===============================

If you already have a local Conda environment, you can use it in your workflow specifying the
installation directory of such environment by using the ``conda`` directive::


  process foo {
    conda '/path/to/an/existing/env/directory'

    '''
    your_command --here
    '''
  }


Best practices
--------------

When a ``conda`` directive is used in any ``process`` definition within the workflow script, Conda tool is required for
the workflow execution.

Specifying the Conda environments in a separate configuration :ref:`profile <config-profiles>` is therefore
recommended to allow the execution via a command line option and to enhance the workflow portability. For example::
  
  profiles {
    conda {
      process.conda = 'samtools'
    }

    docker {
      process.container = 'biocontainers/samtools'
      docker.enabled = true
    }
  }

The above configuration snippet allows the execution either with Conda or Docker specifying ``-profile conda`` or
``-profile docker`` when running the workflow script.


Advanced settings
-----------------


Conda advanced configuration settings are described in the :ref:`Conda <config-conda>` section on the Nextflow configuration page.
