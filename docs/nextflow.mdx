Nextflow is a workflow system for creating scalable, portable, and reproducible workflows. It uses a dataflow programming model that simplifies writing parallel and distributed pipelines by allowing you to focus on data flow and computation. Nextflow can deploy workflows on a variety of execution platforms, including your local machine, HPC schedulers, and cloud. Additionally, Nextflow supports a range of compute environments, software container runtimes, and package managers, allowing workflows to be executed in reproducible and isolated environments.

## Get started

To get started with Nextflow:

1. See the Nextflow [overview][overview-page] to learn key concepts.
2. Download and [install][install-page] Nextflow.
3. Set up an [environment][devenv-page] with the [Nextflow VS Code extension][devenv-nextflow].
4. Run [your first script][your-first-script].

To continue learning about Nextflow, visit the [Nextflow community training portal](https://training.nextflow.io/latest/) and find a training course that is right for you. Seqera, the company that develops Nextflow, also runs a variety of training events. See [Seqera Events](https://seqera.io/events/) for more information.

## Community

You can post questions in the [Nextflow community forum](https://community.seqera.io) or the [Nextflow Slack](https://www.nextflow.io/slack-invite.html). Bugs and feature requests should be reported as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow/issues/new/choose).

The Nextflow community is highly active with regular community meetings, events, a podcast, and more. You can view this material on the [Nextflow](https://www.youtube.com/@Nextflow) YouTube channel.

The [nf-core](https://nf-co.re/) project is a community effort aggregating high-quality Nextflow workflows that can be used by everyone.
