## `env`

The `env` scope allows the definition one or more variables that will be exported into the environment where workflow tasks are executed.

Simply prefix your variable names with the `env` scope or surround them by curly brackets, as shown below:

```groovy
env.ALPHA = 'some value'
env.BETA = "$HOME/some/path"

env {
     DELTA = 'one more'
     GAMMA = "/my/path:$PATH"
}

: Max attempts when retrying failed job submissions (default: `3`). Used only by grid executors.

`executor.retry.maxDelay`
: :::{versionadded} 22.03.0-edge
  :::
: Max delay when retrying failed job submissions (default: `30s`). Used only by grid executors.

`executor.retry.reason`
: :::{versionadded} 22.03.0-edge
  :::
: Regex pattern that when verified cause a failed submit operation to be re-tried (default: `Socket timed out`). Used only by grid executors.

`executor.submitRateLimit`
: Determines the max rate of job submission per time unit, for example `'10sec'` (10 jobs per second) or `'50/2min'` (50 jobs every 2 minutes) (default: unlimited).

Some executor settings have different default values depending on the executor.

| Executor       | `queueSize` | `pollInterval` |
| -------------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| AWS Batch      | `1000`      | `10s`          |
| Azure Batch    | `1000`      | `10s`          |
| Google Batch   | `1000`      | `10s`          |
| Grid Executors | `100`       | `5s`           |
| Kubernetes     | `100`       | `5s`           |
| Local          | N/A         | `100ms`        |

The executor settings can be defined as shown below:

```groovy
executor {
    name = 'sge'
    queueSize = 200
    pollInterval = '30 sec'
}
```

When using two (or more) different executors in your pipeline, you can specify their settings separately by prefixing the executor name with the symbol `$` and using it as special scope identifier. For example:

```groovy
executor {
  $sge {
      queueSize = 100
      pollInterval = '30sec'
  }

  $local {
      cpus = 8
      memory = '32 GB'
  }
}
```

The above configuration example can be rewritten using the dot notation as shown below:

```groovy
executor.$sge.queueSize = 100
executor.$sge.pollInterval = '30sec'
executor.$local.cpus = 8
executor.$local.memory = '32 GB'
```

See `--oci` flag in the [Singularity documentation](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/4.0/user-guide/oci_runtime.html#oci-mode) for more details and requirements (default: `false`).

  :::{note}
  Leave `ociMode` disabled if you are willing to build a Singularity native image with Wave (see the {ref}`wave-singularity` section).
  :::

`singularity.pullTimeout`
: The amount of time the Singularity pull can last, exceeding which the process is terminated (default: `20 min`).

`singularity.registry`
: :::{versionadded} 22.12.0-edge
  :::
: The registry from where Docker images are pulled. It should be only used to specify a private registry server. It should NOT include the protocol prefix i.e. `http://`.

`singularity.runOptions`
: This attribute can be used to provide any extra command line options supported by `singularity exec`.

Read the {ref}`container-singularity` page to learn more about how to use Singularity containers with Nextflow.

(config-spack)=

## `spack`

The `spack` scope controls the creation of a Spack environment by the Spack package manager.

The following settings are available:

`spack.cacheDir`
: Defines the path where Spack environments are stored. When using a compute cluster make sure to provide a shared file system path accessible from all compute nodes.

`spack.checksum`
: Enables checksum verification for source tarballs (default: `true`). Only disable when requesting a package version not yet encoded in the corresponding Spack recipe.

`spack.createTimeout`
: Defines the amount of time the Spack environment creation can last. The creation process is terminated when the timeout is exceeded (default: `60 min`).

`spack.parallelBuilds`
: Sets number of parallel package builds (Spack default: coincides with number of available CPU cores).

Nextflow does not allow for fine-grained configuration of the Spack package manager. Instead, this has to be performed directly on the host Spack installation. For more information see the [Spack documentation](https://spack.readthedocs.io).

  Your `accessToken` can be obtained from your Seqera Platform instance in the [Tokens page](https://cloud.seqera.io/tokens).

`tower.enabled`
: When `true` Nextflow sends the workflow tracing and execution metrics to Seqera Platform (default: `false`).

`tower.endpoint`
: The endpoint of your Seqera Platform instance (default: `https://api.cloud.seqera.io`).

`tower.workspaceId`
: The ID of the Seqera Platform workspace where the run should be added (default: the launching user personal workspace).

  The workspace ID can also be specified using the environment variable `TOWER_WORKSPACE_ID` (config file has priority over the environment variable).

(config-trace)=

## `trace`

The `trace` scope controls the layout of the execution trace file generated by Nextflow.

The following settings are available:

`trace.enabled`
: When `true` turns on the generation of the execution trace report file (default: `false`).

`trace.fields`
: Comma separated list of fields to be included in the report. The available fields are listed at {ref}`this page <trace-fields>`.

`trace.file`
: Trace file name (default: `trace-<timestamp>.txt`).

`trace.overwrite`
: When `true` overwrites any existing trace file with the same name.

`trace.raw`
: When `true` turns on raw number report generation i.e. date and time are reported as milliseconds and memory as number of bytes.

`trace.sep`
: Character used to separate values in each row (default: `\t`).

The above options can also be specified in a `trace` block, for example:

```groovy
trace {
    enabled = true
    file = 'pipeline_trace.txt'
    fields = 'task_id,name,status,exit,realtime,%cpu,rss'
}
```

  target registry instead of the original one.
: The resulting copied containers will maintain the name, digest and metadata.
: The target registry is expected to be specified by using the `wave.build.repository` option.
: :::{note}

  * `required`: The containers used by your pipeline are scanned for security vulnerability. The task is only executed if the corresponding container is not affected by a security vulnerability.

`wave.scan.allowedLevels`
: :::{versionadded} 24.09.1-edge
  :::
: Determines the allowed security levels when scanning containers for security vulnerabilities.

: Allowed values are: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical`. For example: `wave.scan.allowedLevels = 'low,medium'`.

: This option requires the use of `wave.scan.mode = 'required'`.
