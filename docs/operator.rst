*******************
Operators
*******************

Nextflow `operators` are methods that allow you to connect channels to each other or to transform values
emitted by a channel applying some user provided rules.

Operators can be separated in to seven groups:

* `Filtering operators`_
* `Transforming operators`_
* `Splitting operators`_
* `Combining operators`_
* `Forking operators`_
* `Maths operators`_
* `Other operators`_

.. note:: The operators :ref:`operator-set` and ``operator-subscribe`` are *terminal* operators
  and therefore need to be the last operator in a chain of combined operators.


Filtering operators
===================

Given a channel, filtering operators allow you to select only the items that comply with a given rule.

The available filter operators are:

* `distinct`_
* `filter`_
* `first`_
* `last`_
* `randomSample`_
* `take`_
* `unique`_
* `until`_

filter
---------

The ``filter`` operator allows you to get only the items emitted by a channel that satisfy a condition and discarding
all the others. The filtering condition can be specified by using either a :ref:`regular expression <script-regexp>`,
a literal value, a type `qualifier` (i.e. a Java class) or any boolean `predicate`.

The following example shows how to filter a channel by using a regular expression that returns only string that
begins with ``a``::

    Channel
        .from( 'a', 'b', 'aa', 'bc', 3, 4.5 )
        .filter( ~/^a.*/ )
        .view()

::

    a
    aa


The following example shows how to filter a channel by specifying the type qualifier ``Number`` so that only numbers
are returned::

    Channel
        .from( 'a', 'b', 'aa', 'bc', 3, 4.5 )
        .filter( Number )
        .view()

::

    3
    4.5




Finally, a filtering condition can be defined by using any a boolean `predicate`. A predicate is expressed by
a :ref:`closure <script-closure>` returning a boolean value. For example the following fragment shows how filter
a channel emitting numbers so that the `odd` values are returned::

    Channel
        .from( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 )
        .filter { it % 2 == 1 }
        .view()

::

    1
    3
    5


.. tip:: In the above example the filter condition is wrapped in curly brackets,
  instead of round brackets, since it specifies a :ref:`closure <script-closure>` as the operator's argument.
  This just is a language syntax-sugar for ``filter({ it.toString().size() == 1 })``




unique
---------

The ``unique`` operator allows you to remove duplicate items from a channel and only emit single items with no repetition.

For example::

    Channel
        .from( 1,1,1,5,7,7,7,3,3 )
        .unique()
        .view()

::

    1
    5
    7
    3


You can also specify an optional :ref:`closure <script-closure>` that customizes the way it distinguishes between unique items.
For example::

    Channel
        .from(1,3,4,5)
        .unique { it % 2 }
        .view()

::

    1
    4


distinct
-----------

The ``distinct`` operator allows you to remove `consecutive` duplicated items from a channel, so that each emitted item
is different from the preceding one. For example::


    Channel
        .from( 1,1,2,2,2,3,1,1,2,2,3 )
        .distinct()
        .subscribe onNext: { println it }, onComplete: { println 'Done' }

::

    1
    2
    3
    1
    2
    3
    Done



You can also specify an optional :ref:`closure <script-closure>` that customizes the way it distinguishes between distinct items.
For example::

    Channel
        .from( 1,1,2,2,2,3,1,1,2,4,6 )
        .distinct { it % 2 }
        .subscribe onNext: { println it }, onComplete: { println 'Done' }


::

    1
    2
    3
    2
    Done


.. _operator-first:

first
--------

The ``first`` operator creates a channel that returns the first item emitted by the source channel, or eventually
the first item that matches an optional condition. The condition can be specified by using a :ref:`regular expression<script-regexp>`,
a Java `class` type or any boolean `predicate`. For example::


    // no condition is specified, emits the very first item: 1
    Channel
        .from( 1, 2, 3 )
        .first()
        .view()


    // emits the first String value: 'a'
    Channel
        .from( 1, 2, 'a', 'b', 3 )
        .first( String )
        .view()

    // emits the first item matching the regular expression: 'aa'
    Channel
        .from( 'a', 'aa', 'aaa' )
        .first( ~/aa.*/ )
        .view()

    // emits the first item for which the predicate evaluates to true: 4
    Channel
        .from( 1,2,3,4,5 )
        .first { it > 3 }
        .view()


randomSample
------------

The ``randomSample`` operator allows you to create a channel emitting the specified number of items randomly taken
from the channel to which is applied. For example::

  Channel
        .from( 1..100 )
        .randomSample( 10 )
        .view()

The above snippet will print 10 numbers in the range from 1 to 100.

The operator supports a second parameter that allows to set the initial `seed` for the random number generator.
By setting it, the ``randomSample`` operator will always return the same pseudo-random sequence. For example::

  Channel
        .from( 1..100 )
        .randomSample( 10, 234 )
        .view()

The above example will print 10 random numbers in the range between 1 and 100. At each run of the script, the same 
sequence will be returned.

take
-------

The ``take`` operator allows you to filter only the first `n` items emitted by a channel. For example::

    Channel
        .from( 1,2,3,4,5,6 )
        .take( 3 )
        .subscribe onNext: { println it }, onComplete: { println 'Done' }

::

    1
    2
    3
    Done

.. note:: By specifying the value ``-1`` the operator takes all values.

See also `until`_.

.. _operator-last:

last
-------

The ``last`` operator creates a channel that only returns the last item emitted by the source channel. For example::

    Channel
        .from( 1,2,3,4,5,6 )
        .last()
        .view()

::

    6


until
-----

The ``until`` operator creates a channel that returns the items emitted by the source channel and stop when
the condition specified is verified. For example::

  Channel
      .from( 3,2,1,5,1,5 )
      .until{ it==5 }
      .view()

::

  3
  2
  1

See also `take`_. 

Transforming operators
======================

Transforming operators are used to transform the items emitted by a channel to new values.

These operators are:

* `buffer`_
* `collate`_
* `collect`_
* `flatten`_
* `flatMap`_
* `groupBy`_
* `groupTuple`_
* `map`_
* `reduce`_
* `toList`_
* `toSortedList`_
* `transpose`_

.. _operator-map:

map
------

The ``map`` operator applies a function of your choosing to every item emitted by a channel, and 
returns the items so obtained as a new channel. The function applied is called the `mapping` function 
and is expressed with a :ref:`closure <script-closure>` as shown in the example below::

    Channel
        .from( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 )
        .map { it * it }
        .subscribe onNext: { println it }, onComplete: { println 'Done' }

::

    1
    4
    9
    16
    25
    Done


.. _operator-flatmap:

flatMap
----------

The ``flatMap`` operator applies a function of your choosing to every item emitted by a channel, and
returns the items so obtained as a new channel. Whenever the `mapping` function returns a list of items,
this list is flattened so that each single item is emitted on its own.  

For example::

    // create a channel of numbers
    numbers = Channel.from( 1, 2, 3 )

    // map each number to a tuple (array), which items are emitted separately
    results = numbers.flatMap { n -> [ n*2, n*3 ] }

    // print the final results
    results.subscribe onNext: { println it }, onComplete: { println 'Done' }

::

    2
    3
    4
    6
    6
    9
    Done


Associative arrays are handled in the same way, so that each array entry is emitted as a single `key-value` item. For example::

    Channel.from ( 1, 2, 3 )
           .flatMap { it -> [ number: it, square: it*it ] }
           .view { it.key + ': ' + it.value }

::

    number: 1
    square: 1
    number: 2
    square: 4
    number: 3
    square: 9


.. _operator-reduce:

reduce
---------

The ``reduce`` operator applies a function of your choosing to every item emitted by a channel.
Each time this function is invoked it takes two parameters: firstly the `i-th` emitted item
and secondly the result of the previous invocation of the function itself. The result is 
passed on to the next function call, along with the `i+1 th` item, until all the items are 
processed.

Finally, the ``reduce`` operator emits the result of the last invocation of your function 
as the sole output.

For example::

    Channel
        .from( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 )
        .reduce { a, b -> println "a: $a b: $b"; return a+b }
        .view { "result = $it" }


It prints the following output::

	a: 1	b: 2
	a: 3	b: 3
	a: 6	b: 4
	a: 10	b: 5
	result = 15


.. note:: In a common usage scenario the first function parameter is used as an `accumulator` and
  the second parameter represents the `i-th` item to be processed.

Optionally you can specify a `seed` value in order to initialise the accumulator parameter
as shown below::

    myChannel.reduce( seedValue ) {  a, b -> ... }



groupBy
----------

.. warning::
    This operator is deprecated. Use the `groupTuple`_ operator instead.

The ``groupBy`` operator collects the values emitted by the source channel grouping them together using a `mapping`
function that associates each item with a key. When finished, it emits an associative
array that maps each key to the set of items identified by that key.  

For example::

    Channel
    	.from('hello','ciao','hola', 'hi', 'bonjour')
    	.groupBy { String str -> str[0] } 
    	.view()

:: 

    [ b:['bonjour'], c:['ciao'], h:['hello','hola','hi'] ]
    

The `mapping` function is an optional parameter. When omitted the values are grouped 
following these rules: 

* Any value of type ``Map`` is associated with the value of its first entry, or ``null`` when the map itself is empty.
* Any value of type ``Map.Entry`` is associated with the value of its ``key`` attribute.
* Any value of type ``Collection`` or ``Array`` is associated with its first entry.
* For any other value, the value itself is used as a key.


.. _operator-grouptuple:

groupTuple
----------

The ``groupTuple`` operator collects tuples (or lists) of values emitted by the source channel grouping together the
elements that share the same key. Finally it emits a new tuple object for each distinct key collected.

In other words transform a sequence of tuple like *(K, V, W, ..)* into a new channel emitting a sequence of
*(K, list(V), list(W), ..)*

For example::

   Channel
        .from( [1,'A'], [1,'B'], [2,'C'], [3, 'B'], [1,'C'], [2, 'A'], [3, 'D'] )
        .groupTuple()
        .view()

It prints::

    [1, [A, B, C]]
    [2, [C, A]]
    [3, [B, D]]

By default the first entry in the tuple is used a the grouping key. A different key can be chosen by using the
``by`` parameter and specifying the index of entry to be used as key (the index is zero-based). For example::

   Channel
        .from( [1,'A'], [1,'B'], [2,'C'], [3, 'B'], [1,'C'], [2, 'A'], [3, 'D'] )
        .groupTuple(by: 1)
        .view()

Grouping by the second value in each tuple the result is::

    [[1, 2], A]
    [[1, 3], B]
    [[2, 1], C]
    [[3], D]


Available parameters:

=========== ============================
Field       Description
=========== ============================
by          The index (zero based) of the element to be used as grouping key.
            A key composed by multiple elements can be defined specifying a list of indices e.g. ``by: [0,2]``
sort        Defines the sorting criteria for the grouped items. See below for available sorting options.
size        The number of items the grouped list(s) has to contain. When the specified size is reached, the tuple is emitted.
remainder   When ``false`` incomplete tuples (i.e. with less than `size` grouped items)
            are discarded (default). When ``true`` incomplete tuples are emitted as the ending emission. Only valid when a ``size`` parameter
            is specified.
=========== ============================

Sorting options:

=============== ========================
Sort            Description
=============== ========================
false           No sorting is applied (default).
true            Order the grouped items by the item natural ordering i.e. numerical for number, lexicographic for string, etc. See http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/interfaces/order.html
hash            Order the grouped items by the hash number associated to each entry.
deep            Similar to the previous, but the hash number is created on actual entries content e.g. when the item is a file the hash is created on the actual file content.
`custom`        A custom sorting criteria used to order the tuples element holding list of values. It can be specified by using either a :ref:`Closure <script-closure>` or a `Comparator <http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Comparator.html>`_ object.
=============== ========================


.. tip:: You should always specify the number of expected element in each tuple using the ``size`` attribute
  to allow the ``groupTuple`` operator to stream the collected values as soon as possible. However there
  are use cases in which each tuple has a different size depending grouping key. In this cases use the
  built-in function ``groupKey`` that allows you to create a special grouping key object to which it's possible
  to associate the group size for a given key.


buffer
---------

The ``buffer`` operator gathers the items emitted by the source channel into subsets and emits these subsets separately.


There are a number of ways you can regulate how ``buffer`` gathers the items from
the source channel into subsets:

* ``buffer( closingCondition )``: starts to collect the items emitted by the channel into 
  a subset until the `closing condition` is verified. After that the subset is emitted 
  to the resulting channel and new items are gathered into a new subset. The process is repeated 
  until the last value in the source channel is sent. The ``closingCondition`` can be specified 
  either as a :ref:`regular expression <script-regexp>`, a Java class, a literal value, or a `boolean predicate`
  that has to be satisfied. For example::
  
    Channel
        .from( 1,2,3,1,2,3 ) 
        .buffer { it == 2 } 
        .view()

    // emitted values
    [1,2]
    [3,1,2]
  
  

* ``buffer( openingCondition, closingCondition )``: starts to gather the items emitted by the channel 
  as soon as one of the them verify the `opening condition` and it continues until there is one item
  which verify the `closing condition`. After that the subset is emitted and it continues applying the 
  described logic until the last channel item is emitted.
  Both conditions can be defined either as a :ref:`regular expression <script-regexp>`, a literal value,
  a Java class, or a `boolean predicate` that need to be satisfied. For example:: 
 
    Channel
        .from( 1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4,5,1,2 ) 
        .buffer( 2, 4 ) 
        .view()

    // emits bundles starting with '2' and ending with'4'
    [2,3,4]
    [2,3,4]      
  

* ``buffer( size: n )``: transform the source channel in such a way that it emits tuples 
  made up of ``n`` elements. An incomplete tuple is discarded. For example::

    Channel
        .from( 1,2,3,1,2,3,1 ) 
        .buffer( size: 2 )
        .view()
        
    // emitted values 
    [1, 2]
    [3, 1]
    [2, 3]

If you want to emit the last items in a tuple containing less than ``n`` elements, simply 
add the parameter ``remainder`` specifying ``true``, for example::

    Channel
        .from( 1,2,3,1,2,3,1 )
        .buffer( size: 2, remainder: true )
        .view()

    // emitted values
    [1, 2]
    [3, 1]
    [2, 3]
    [1]



* ``buffer( size: n, skip: m )``: as in the previous example, it emits tuples containing ``n`` elements, 
  but skips `m` values before starting to collect the values for the next tuple (including the first emission). For example::

    Channel
        .from( 1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4,5,1,2 ) 
        .buffer( size:3, skip:2 )
        .view()
        
    // emitted values 
    [3, 4, 5]
    [3, 4, 5]

If you want to emit the remaining items in a tuple containing less than ``n`` elements, simply
add the parameter ``remainder`` specifying ``true``, as shown in the previous example.

See also: `collate`_ operator.


collate
---------

The ``collate`` operator transforms a channel in such a way that the emitted values are grouped in tuples containing `n` items. For example::

    Channel
        .from(1,2,3,1,2,3,1)
        .collate( 3 )
        .view()

::

        [1, 2, 3]
        [1, 2, 3]
        [1]

As shown in the above example the last tuple may be incomplete e.g. contain less elements than the specified size.
If you want to avoid this, specify ``false`` as the second parameter. For example::

    Channel
        .from(1,2,3,1,2,3,1)
        .collate( 3, false )
        .view()

::

        [1, 2, 3]
        [1, 2, 3]


A second version of the ``collate`` operator allows you to specify, after the `size`, the `step` by which elements
are collected in tuples. For example::

    Channel
      .from(1,2,3,4)
      .collate( 3, 1 )
      .view()

::

    [1, 2, 3]
    [2, 3, 4]
    [3, 4]
    [4]

As before, if you don't want to emit the last items which do not complete a tuple, specify ``false`` as the third parameter.


See also: `buffer`_ operator.

.. _operator-collect:

collect
-------

The ``collect`` operator collects all the items emitted by a channel to a ``List`` and return
the resulting object as a sole emission. For example::

    Channel
        .from( 1, 2, 3, 4 )
        .collect()
        .view()

    # outputs
    [1,2,3,4]

An optional :ref:`closure <script-closure>` can be specified to transform each item before adding it to the resulting list.
For example::

    Channel
        .from( 'hello', 'ciao', 'bonjour' )
        .collect { it.length() }
        .view()

    # outputs
    [5,4,7]

.. Available parameters:
..
.. =========== ============================
.. Field       Description
.. =========== ============================
.. flat        When ``true`` nested list structures are normalised and their items are added to the resulting list object (default: ``true``).
.. sort        When ``true`` the items in the resulting list are sorted by their natural ordering. It is possible to provide a custom ordering criteria by using either a :ref:`closure <script-closure>` or a `Comparator <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Comparator.html>`_ object (default: ``false``).
.. =========== ============================

See also: `toList`_ and `toSortedList`_ operator.

.. _operator-flatten:

flatten
----------

The ``flatten`` operator transforms a channel in such a way that every item of type ``Collection`` or ``Array``
is flattened so that each single entry is emitted separately by the resulting channel. For example::

    Channel
    	.from( [1,[2,3]], 4, [5,[6]] )
    	.flatten()
    	.view()

:: 
    
    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6
    
    
See also: `flatMap`_ operator.



toList
---------

The ``toList`` operator collects all the items emitted by a channel to a ``List`` object
and emits the resulting collection as a single item. For example::

    Channel
    	.from( 1, 2, 3, 4 )
    	.toList() 
    	.subscribe onNext: { println it }, onComplete: 'Done'
    	
::
 
    [1,2,3,4]
    Done

See also: `collect`_ operator.

toSortedList
---------------


The ``toSortedList`` operator collects all the items emitted by a channel to a ``List`` object where they are sorted
and emits the resulting collection as a single item. For example::

    Channel
    	.from( 3, 2, 1, 4 )
    	.toSortedList()
    	.subscribe onNext: { println it }, onComplete: 'Done'

::

    [1,2,3,4]
    Done

You may also pass a comparator closure as an argument to the ``toSortedList`` operator to customize the sorting criteria.  For example, to sort by the second element of a tuple in descending order::

    Channel
        .from( ["homer", 5], ["bart", 2], ["lisa", 10], ["marge", 3], ["maggie", 7])
        .toSortedList( { a, b -> b[1] <=> a[1] } )
        .view()

::

   [[lisa, 10], [maggie, 7], [homer, 5], [marge, 3], [bart, 2]]

See also: `collect`_ operator.

transpose
---------

The ``transpose`` operator transforms a channel in such a way that the emitted items are the result of a transposition
of all tuple elements in each item. For example::

    Channel.from([
       ['a', ['p', 'q'], ['u','v'] ],
       ['b', ['s', 't'], ['x','y'] ]
       ])
       .transpose()
       .view()

The above snippet prints::

    [a, p, u]
    [a, q, v]
    [b, s, x]
    [b, t, y]


Available parameters:

=========== ============================
Field       Description
=========== ============================
by          The index (zero based) of the element to be transposed.
            Multiple elements can be defined specifying as list of indices e.g. ``by: [0,2]``
remainder   When ``false`` incomplete tuples are discarded (default). When ``true`` incomplete tuples are emitted
            containing a `null` in place of a missing element.
=========== ============================


Splitting operators
====================

These operators are used to split items emitted by channels into chunks that can be processed by downstream
operators or processes.

The available splitting operators are:

* `splitCsv`_
* `splitFasta`_
* `splitFastq`_
* `splitText`_


splitCsv
---------

The ``splitCsv`` operator allows you to parse text items emitted by a channel, that are formatted using the
`CSV format <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values>`_, and split them into records or group them into
list of records with a specified length.

In the simplest case just apply the ``splitCsv`` operator to a channel emitting a CSV formatted text files or
text entries. For example::

    Channel
        .from( 'alpha,beta,gamma\n10,20,30\n70,80,90' )
        .splitCsv()
        .view { row -> "${row[0]} - ${row[1]} - ${row[2]}" }

The above example shows hows CSV text is parsed and is split into single rows. Values can be accessed
by its column index in the row object.

When the CSV begins with a header line defining the columns names, you can specify the parameter ``header: true`` which
allows you to reference each value by its name, as shown in the following example::

    Channel
        .from( 'alpha,beta,gamma\n10,20,30\n70,80,90' )
        .splitCsv(header: true)
        .view { row -> "${row.alpha} - ${row.beta} - ${row.gamma}" }

It will print ::

 10 - 20 - 30
 70 - 80 - 90

Alternatively you can provide custom header names by specifying a the list of strings in the ``header`` parameter
as shown below::


    Channel
        .from( 'alpha,beta,gamma\n10,20,30\n70,80,90' )
        .splitCsv(header: ['col1', 'col2', 'col3'], skip: 1 )
        .view { row -> "${row.col1} - ${row.col2} - ${row.col3}" }


Available parameters:

=========== ============================
Field       Description
=========== ============================
by          The number of rows in each `chunk`
sep         The character used to separate the values (default: ``,``)
quote       Values may be quoted by single or double quote characters.
header      When ``true`` the first line is used as columns names. Alternatively it can be used to provide the list of columns names.
charset     Parse the content by using the specified charset e.g. ``UTF-8``
strip       Removes leading and trailing blanks from values (default: ``false``)
skip        Number of lines since the file beginning to ignore when parsing the CSV content.
limit       Limits the number of retrieved records for each file to the specified value.
decompress  When ``true`` decompress the content using the GZIP format before processing it (note: files whose name ends with ``.gz`` extension are decompressed automatically)
elem        The index of the element to split when the operator is applied to a channel emitting list/tuple objects (default: first file object or first element)
=========== ============================


splitFasta
------------

The ``splitFasta`` operator allows you to split the entries emitted by a channel, that are formatted using the
`FASTA format <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format>`_. It returns a channel which emits text item
for each sequence in the received FASTA content.

The number of sequences in each text chunk produced by the ``splitFasta`` operator can be set by using
the ``by`` parameter. The following example shows how to read a FASTA file and split it into chunks containing 10 sequences
each::

   Channel
        .fromPath('misc/sample.fa')
        .splitFasta( by: 10 )
        .view()

.. warning:: By default chunks are kept in memory. When splitting big files specify the parameter ``file: true`` to save the
  chunks into files in order to not incur in a ``OutOfMemoryException``. See the available parameter table below for details.

A second version of the ``splitFasta`` operator allows you to split a FASTA content into record objects, instead
of text chunks. A record object contains a set of fields that let you access and manipulate the FASTA sequence
information with ease.


In order to split a FASTA content into record objects, simply use the ``record`` parameter specifying the map of
required the fields, as shown in the example below::

   Channel
        .fromPath('misc/sample.fa')
        .splitFasta( record: [id: true, seqString: true ])
        .filter { record -> record.id =~ /^ENST0.*/ }
        .view { record -> record.seqString }


.. note:: In this example, the file ``misc/sample.fa`` is split into records containing the ``id`` and the ``seqString`` fields
  (i.e. the sequence id and the sequence data). The following ``filter`` operator only keeps the sequences which ID
  starts with the ``ENST0`` prefix, finally the sequence content is printed by using the ``subscribe`` operator.

Available parameters:

=========== ============================
Field       Description
=========== ============================
by          Defines the number of sequences in each `chunk` (default: ``1``)
size        Defines the size in memory units of the expected chunks eg. `1.MB`.
limit       Limits the number of retrieved sequences for each file to the specified value.
record      Parse each entry in the FASTA file as record objects (see following table for accepted values)
charset     Parse the content by using the specified charset e.g. ``UTF-8``
compress    When ``true`` resulting file chunks are GZIP compressed. The ``.gz`` suffix is automatically added to chunk file names.
decompress  When ``true``, decompress the content using the GZIP format before processing it (note: files whose name ends with ``.gz`` extension are decompressed automatically)
file        When ``true`` saves each split to a file. Use a string instead of ``true`` value to create split files with a specific name (split index number is automatically added). Finally, set this attribute to an existing directory, in order to save the split files into the specified folder.
elem        The index of the element to split when the operator is applied to a channel emitting list/tuple objects (default: first file object or first element)
=========== ============================


The following fields are available when using the ``record`` parameter:

=========== ============================
Field       Description
=========== ============================
id          The FASTA sequence identifier i.e. the word following the ``>`` symbol up to the first `blank` or `newline` character
header      The first line in a FASTA sequence without the ``>`` character
desc        The text in the FASTA header following the ID value
text        The complete FASTA sequence including the header
seqString   The sequence data as a single line string i.e. containing no `newline` characters
sequence    The sequence data as a multi-line string (always ending with a `newline` character)
width       Define the length of a single line when the ``sequence`` field is used, after that the sequence data continues on a new line.
=========== ============================



splitFastq
----------

The ``splitFastq`` operator allows you to split the entries emitted by a channel, that are formatted using the
`FASTQ format <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format>`_. It returns a channel which emits a text chunk
for each sequence in the received item.

The number of sequences in each text chunk produced by the ``splitFastq`` operator is defined by the
parameter ``by``. The following example shows you how to read a FASTQ file and split it into chunks containing 10
sequences each::

   Channel
        .fromPath('misc/sample.fastq')
        .splitFastq( by: 10 )
        .view()


.. warning:: By default chunks are kept in memory. When splitting big files specify the parameter ``file: true`` to save the
  chunks into files in order to not incur in a ``OutOfMemoryException``. See the available parameter table below for details.


A second version of the ``splitFastq`` operator allows you to split a FASTQ formatted content into record objects,
instead of text chunks. A record object contains a set of fields that let you access and manipulate the FASTQ sequence
data with ease.

In order to split FASTQ sequences into record objects simply use the ``record`` parameter specifying the map of
the required fields, or just specify ``record: true`` as in the example shown below::

   Channel
        .fromPath('misc/sample.fastq')
        .splitFastq( record: true )
        .view { record -> record.readHeader }


Finally the ``splitFastq`` operator is able to split paired-end read pair FASTQ files. It must be applied to a channel
which emits tuples containing at least two elements that are the files to be splitted. For example::

    Channel
        .fromFilePairs('/my/data/SRR*_{1,2}.fastq', flat:true)
        .splitFastq(by: 100_000, pe:true, file:true)
        .view()


.. note:: The ``fromFilePairs`` requires the ``flat:true`` option to have the file pairs as separate elements
  in the produced tuples.

.. warning:: This operator assumes that the order of the PE reads correspond with each other and both files contain
  the same number of reads.


Available parameters:

=========== ============================
Field       Description
=========== ============================
by          Defines the number of *reads* in each `chunk` (default: ``1``)
pe          When ``true`` splits paired-end read files, therefore items emitted by the source channel must be tuples in which at least two elements are the read-pair files to be splitted.
limit       Limits the number of retrieved *reads* for each file to the specified value.
record      Parse each entry in the FASTQ file as record objects (see following table for accepted values)
charset     Parse the content by using the specified charset e.g. ``UTF-8``
compress    When ``true`` resulting file chunks are GZIP compressed. The ``.gz`` suffix is automatically added to chunk file names.
decompress  When ``true`` decompress the content using the GZIP format before processing it (note: files whose name ends with ``.gz`` extension are decompressed automatically)
file        When ``true`` saves each split to a file. Use a string instead of ``true`` value to create split files with a specific name (split index number is automatically added). Finally, set this attribute to an existing directory, in order to save the split files into the specified folder.
elem        The index of the element to split when the operator is applied to a channel emitting list/tuple objects (default: first file object or first element)
=========== ============================

The following fields are available when using the ``record`` parameter:

=============== ============================
Field           Description
=============== ============================
readHeader      Sequence header (without the ``@`` prefix)
readString      The raw sequence data
qualityHeader   Base quality header (it may be empty)
qualityString   Quality values for the sequence
=============== ============================

splitText
----------

The ``splitText`` operator allows you to split multi-line strings or text file items, emitted by a source channel
into chunks containing `n` lines, which will be emitted by the resulting channel.

For example::

   Channel
        .fromPath('/some/path/*.txt')
        .splitText()
        .view()


It splits the content of the files with suffix ``.txt``, and prints it line by line.

By default the ``splitText`` operator splits each item into chunks of one line. You can define the number of lines in each chunk by using
the parameter ``by``, as shown in the following example::


   Channel
        .fromPath('/some/path/*.txt')
        .splitText( by: 10 )
        .subscribe {
            print it;
            print "--- end of the chunk ---\n"
        }


An optional :ref:`closure <script-closure>` can be specified in order to `transform` the text chunks produced by the operator.
The following example shows how to split text files into chunks of 10 lines and transform them to capital letters::

     Channel
        .fromPath('/some/path/*.txt')
        .splitText( by: 10 ) { it.toUpperCase() }
        .view()


.. note:: Text chunks returned by the operator ``splitText`` are always terminated by a ``newline`` character.


Available parameters:

=========== ============================
Field       Description
=========== ============================
by          Defines the number of lines in each `chunk` (default: ``1``).
limit       Limits the number of retrieved lines for each file to the specified value.
charset     Parse the content by using the specified charset e.g. ``UTF-8``.
compress    When ``true`` resulting file chunks are GZIP compressed. The ``.gz`` suffix is automatically added to chunk file names.
decompress  When ``true``, decompress the content using the GZIP format before processing it (note: files whose name ends with ``.gz`` extension are decompressed automatically).
file        When ``true`` saves each split to a file. Use a string instead of ``true`` value to create split files with a specific name (split index number is automatically added). Finally, set this attribute to an existing directory, in oder to save the split files into the specified folder.
elem        The index of the element to split when the operator is applied to a channel emitting list/tuple objects (default: first file object or first element).
keepHeader  Parses the first line as header and prepends it to each emitted chunk.
=========== ============================


Combining operators
=====================

The combining operators are:

* `cross`_
* `collectFile`_
* `combine`_
* `concat`_
* `join`_
* `merge`_
* `mix`_
* `phase`_
* `spread`_
* `tap`_


.. _operator-join:

join
-----

The ``join`` operator creates a channel that joins together the items emitted by two channels for which exists
a matching key. The key is defined, by default, as the first element in each item emitted.

For example::

  left = Channel.from(['X', 1], ['Y', 2], ['Z', 3], ['P', 7])
  right= Channel.from(['Z', 6], ['Y', 5], ['X', 4])
  left.join(right).view()

The resulting channel emits::

  [Z, 3, 6]
  [Y, 2, 5]
  [X, 1, 4]

The `index` of a different matching element can be specified by using the ``by`` parameter.

The ``join`` operator can emit all the pairs that are incomplete, i.e. the items for which a matching element
is missing, by specifying the optional parameter ``remainder`` as shown below::

    left = Channel.from(['X', 1], ['Y', 2], ['Z', 3], ['P', 7])
    right= Channel.from(['Z', 6], ['Y', 5], ['X', 4])
    left.join(right, remainder: true).view()

The above example prints::

    [Y, 2, 5]
    [Z, 3, 6]
    [X, 1, 4]
    [P, 7, null]


The following parameters can be used with the ``join`` operator:

=============== ========================
Name            Description
=============== ========================
by              The index (zero based) of the element to be used as grouping key.
                A key composed by multiple elements can be defined specifying a list of indices e.g. ``by: [0,2]``
remainder       When ``false`` incomplete tuples (i.e. with less than `size` grouped items)
                are discarded (default). When ``true`` incomplete tuples are emitted as the ending emission.
failOnDuplicate An error is reported when the same key is found more than once.
failOnMismatch  An error is reported when a channel emits a value for which there isn't a corresponding element in the joining channel. This option cannot be used with ``remainder``.
=============== ========================


.. _operator-merge:

merge
--------

.. warning::
    This operator is deprecated and it will be removed in upcoming release.

The ``merge`` operator lets you join items emitted by two (or more) channels into a new channel.

For example the following code merges two channels together, one which emits a series of odd integers
and the other which emits a series of even integers::

    odds  = Channel.from([1, 3, 5, 7, 9]);
    evens = Channel.from([2, 4, 6]);

    odds
        .merge( evens )
        .view()

::

    [1, 2]
    [3, 4]
    [5, 6]

An option closure can be provide to customise the items emitted by the resulting merged channel. For example::

    odds  = Channel.from([1, 3, 5, 7, 9]);
    evens = Channel.from([2, 4, 6]);

    odds
        .merge( evens ) { a, b -> tuple(b*b, a) }
        .view()

.. _operator-mix:

mix
------

The ``mix`` operator combines the items emitted by two (or more) channels into a single channel.


For example::

        c1 = Channel.from( 1,2,3 )
        c2 = Channel.from( 'a','b' )
        c3 = Channel.from( 'z' )

        c1 .mix(c2,c3)
           .subscribe onNext: { println it }, onComplete: { println 'Done' }

::

        1
        2
        3
        'a'
        'b'
        'z'

.. note:: The items emitted by the resulting mixed channel may appear in any order,
  regardless of which source channel they came from. Thus, the following example
  it could be a possible result of the above example as well.

::

          'z'
          1
          'a'
          2
          'b'
          3


.. _operator-phase:

phase
--------

.. warning:: This operator is deprecated. Use the `join`_ operator instead.

The ``phase`` operator creates a channel that synchronizes the values emitted by two other channels,
in such a way that it emits pairs of items that have a matching key.

The key is defined, by default, as the first entry in an array, a list or map object,
or the value itself for any other data type.

For example::

        ch1 = Channel.from( 1,2,3 )
        ch2 = Channel.from( 1,0,0,2,7,8,9,3 )
        ch1 .phase(ch2) .view()

It prints::

    [1,1]
    [2,2]
    [3,3]


Optionally, a mapping function can be specified in order to provide a custom rule to associate an item to a key,
as shown in the following example::


    ch1 = Channel.from( [sequence: 'aaaaaa', id: 1], [sequence: 'bbbbbb', id: 2] )
    ch2 = Channel.from( [val: 'zzzz', id: 3], [val: 'xxxxx', id: 1], [val: 'yyyyy', id: 2])
    ch1 .phase(ch2) { it -> it.id } .view()


It prints::

    [[sequence:aaaaaa, id:1], [val:xxxxx, id:1]]
    [[sequence:bbbbbb, id:2], [val:yyyyy, id:2]]


Finally, the ``phase`` operator can emit all the pairs that are incomplete, i.e. the items for which a matching element
is missing, by specifying the optional parameter ``remainder`` as shown below::

        ch1 = Channel.from( 1,0,0,2,5,3 )
        ch2 = Channel.from( 1,2,3,4 )
        ch1 .phase(ch2, remainder: true) .view()

It prints::

    [1, 1]
    [2, 2]
    [3, 3]
    [0, null]
    [0, null]
    [5, null]
    [null, 4]

See also `join`_ operator.

.. _operator-cross:

cross
-------

The ``cross`` operators allows you to combine the items of two channels in such a way that
the items of the source channel are emitted along with the items emitted by the target channel 
for which they have a matching key.  

The key is defined, by default, as the first entry in an array, a list or map object,
or the value itself for any other data type. For example:: 

	source = Channel.from( [1, 'alpha'], [2, 'beta'] )
	target = Channel.from( [1, 'x'], [1, 'y'], [1, 'z'], [2,'p'], [2,'q'], [2,'t'] )

	source.cross(target).view()

It will output:: 

	[ [1, alpha], [1, x] ]
	[ [1, alpha], [1, y] ]
	[ [1, alpha], [1, z] ]
	[ [2, beta],  [2, p] ]
	[ [2, beta],  [2, q] ]
	[ [2, beta],  [2, t] ]

The above example shows how the items emitted by the source channels are associated to the ones
emitted by the target channel (on the right) having the same key. 

There are two important caveats when using the ``cross`` operator:

	#. The operator is not `reflexive`, i.e. the result of ``a.cross(b)`` is different from ``b.cross(a)`` 
	#. The source channel should emits items for which there's no key repetition i.e. the emitted 
	   items have an unique key identifier. 

Optionally, a mapping function can be specified in order to provide a custom rule to associate an item to a key,
in a similar manner as shown for the `phase`_ operator.

collectFile
-----------

The ``collectFile`` operator allows you to gather the items emitted by a channel and save them to one or more files.
The operator returns a new channel that emits the collected file(s).

In the simplest case, just specify the name of a file where the entries have to be stored. For example::

    Channel
        .from('alpha', 'beta', 'gamma')
        .collectFile(name: 'sample.txt', newLine: true)
        .subscribe {
            println "Entries are saved to file: $it"
            println "File content is: ${it.text}"
        }



A second version of the ``collectFile`` operator allows you to gather the items emitted by a channel and group them together
into files whose name can be defined by a dynamic criteria. The grouping criteria is specified by a :ref:`closure <script-closure>`
that must return a pair in which the first element defines the file name for the group and the second element the actual
value to be appended to that file. For example::

     Channel
        .from('Hola', 'Ciao', 'Hello', 'Bonjour', 'Halo')
        .collectFile() { item ->
            [ "${item[0]}.txt", item + '\n' ]
        }
        .subscribe {
            println "File ${it.name} contains:"
            println it.text
        }

It will print::

    File 'B.txt' contains:
    Bonjour

    File 'C.txt' contains:
    Ciao

    File 'H.txt' contains:
    Halo
    Hola
    Hello


.. tip:: When the items emitted by the source channel are files, the grouping criteria can be omitted. In this case
  the items content will be grouped in file(s) having the same name as the source items.


The following parameters can be used with the ``collectFile`` operator:

=============== ========================
Name            Description
=============== ========================
``keepHeader``  Prepend the resulting file with the header fetched in the first collected file. The header size (ie. lines) can be specified by using the ``skip`` parameter (default: ``false``), to determine how many lines to remove from all collected files except for the first (where no lines will be removed).
``name``        Name of the file where all received values are stored.
``newLine``     Appends a ``newline`` character automatically after each entry (default: ``false``).
``seed``        A value or a map of values used to initialise the files content.
``skip``        Skip the first `n` lines eg. ``skip: 1``.
``sort``        Defines sorting criteria of content in resulting file(s). See below for sorting options.
``storeDir``    Folder where the resulting file(s) are be stored.
``tempDir``     Folder where temporary files, used by the collecting process, are stored.
=============== ========================

.. note:: The file content is sorted in such a way that it does not depend on the order on which
    entries have been added to it, this guarantees that it is consistent (i.e. do not change) across different executions
    with the same data.

The ordering of file's content can be defined by using the ``sort`` parameter. The following criteria
can be specified:

=============== ========================
Sort            Description
=============== ========================
``false``       Disable content sorting. Entries are appended as they are produced.
``true``        Order the content by the entries natural ordering i.e. numerical for number, lexicographic for string, etc. See http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/interfaces/order.html
``'index'``     Order the content by the incremental index number assigned to each entry while they are collected.
``'hash'``      Order the content by the hash number associated to each entry (default)
``'deep'``      Similar to the previous, but the hash number is created on actual entries content e.g. when the entry is a file the hash is created on the actual file content.
`custom`        A custom sorting criteria can be specified by using either a :ref:`Closure <script-closure>` or a `Comparator <http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Comparator.html>`_ object.
=============== ========================

For example the following snippet shows how sort the content of the result file alphabetically::

     Channel
        .from('Z'..'A')
        .collectFile(name:'result', sort: true, newLine: true)
        .view { it.text }

It will print::

        A
        B
        C
        :
        Z


The following example shows how use a `closure` to collect and sort all sequences in a FASTA file from shortest to longest::

    Channel
         .fromPath('/data/sequences.fa')
         .splitFasta( record: [id: true, sequence: true] )
         .collectFile( name:'result.fa', sort: { it.size() } )  {
            it.sequence
          }
         .view { it.text }


.. warning:: The ``collectFile`` operator to carry out its function need to store in a temporary folder that is
 automatically deleted on job completion. For performance reason this folder is allocated in the machine local storage,
 and it will require as much free space as are the data you are collecting. Optionally, an alternative temporary data
 folder can be specified by using the ``tempDir`` parameter.

.. _operator-combine:

combine
-------

The ``combine`` operator combines (cartesian product) the items emitted by two channels or by a channel and a ``Collection``
object (as right operand). For example::

    numbers = Channel.from(1,2,3)
    words = Channel.from('hello', 'ciao')
    numbers
        .combine(words)
        .view()

    # outputs
    [1, hello]
    [2, hello]
    [3, hello]
    [1, ciao]
    [2, ciao]
    [3, ciao]

A second version of the ``combine`` operator allows you to combine between them those items that share a common
matching key. The index of the key element is specified by using the ``by`` parameter (the index is zero-based,
multiple indexes can be specified with list a integers).
For example::

    left = Channel.from(['A',1], ['B',2], ['A',3])
    right = Channel.from(['B','x'], ['B','y'], ['A','z'], ['A', 'w'])

    left
        .combine(right, by: 0)
        .view()

    # outputs
    [A, 1, z]
    [A, 3, z]
    [A, 1, w]
    [A, 3, w]
    [B, 2, x]
    [B, 2, y]


See also `join`_, `cross`_, `spread`_ and `phase`_.

.. _operator-concat:

concat
--------

The ``concat`` operator allows you to `concatenate` the items emitted by two or more channels to a new channel, in such
a way that the items emitted by the resulting channel are in same order as they were when specified as operator arguments.

In other words it guarantees that given any `n` channels, the concatenation channel emits the items proceeding from the channel `i+1 th`
only after `all` the items proceeding from the channel `i th` were emitted.

For example::

    a = Channel.from('a','b','c')
    b = Channel.from(1,2,3)
    c = Channel.from('p','q')

    c.concat( b, a ).view()

It will output::

    p
    q
    1
    2
    3
    a
    b
    c

.. _operator-spread:

spread
---------

.. warning:: This operator is deprecated. See `combine`_ instead.

The ``spread`` operator combines the items emitted by the source channel with all the values in an array
or a ``Collection`` object specified as the operator argument. For example::

    Channel
        .from(1,2,3)
        .spread(['a','b'])
        .subscribe onNext: { println it }, onComplete: { println 'Done' }

::

    [1, 'a']
    [1, 'b']
    [2, 'a']
    [2, 'b']
    [3, 'a']
    [3, 'b']
    Done




Forking operators
=================

The forking operators are:

* `branch`_
* `choice`_
* `multiMap`_
* `into`_
* `separate`_
* `tap`_

.. _operator-branch:

branch
------

.. note:: Requires Nextflow version ``19.08.0-edge`` or later.

The ``branch`` operator allows you to forward the items emitted by a source channel to one
or more output channels, `choosing` one out of them at a time.

The selection criteria is defined by specifying a :ref:`closure <script-closure>` that provides
one or more boolean expression, each of which is identified by a unique label. On the first expression 
that evaluates to a *true* value, the current item is bound to a named channel as the label identifier.
For example::

    Channel
        .from(1,2,3,40,50)
        .branch {
            small: it < 10
            large: it > 10
        }
        .set { result }

     result.small.view { "$it is small" }
     result.large.view { "$it is large" }

It shows::

    1 is small
    2 is small
    3 is small
    40 is large
    50 is large

.. note:: The above *small* and *large* strings maybe be printed interleaving each other
  due to the asynchronous execution of the ``view`` operator.

.. tip:: A default fallback condition can be specified using ``true`` as last branch condition. See the example below.

::

    Channel
        .from(1,2,3,40,50)
        .branch {
            small: it < 10
            large: it < 50
            other: true
        }


The value returned by each branch condition can be customised by specifying an optional expression statement(s)
just after the condition expression. For example::

       Channel
        .from(1,2,3,40,50)
        .branch {
            foo: it < 10
                return it+2

            bar: it < 50
                return it-2

            other: true
                return 0
        }


.. tip:: When the ``return`` keyword is omitted the value of the last expression statement is
  implicitly returned.

.. warning:: The branch evaluation closure must be specified inline, ie. it *cannot* be assigned to a
  variable and passed as argument to the operator, how it can be done with other operators.

To create a branch criteria as variable that can be passed as an argument to more than one
``branch`` operator use the ``branchCriteria`` built-in method as shown below::

    def criteria = branchCriteria {
                    small: it < 10
                    large: it > 10
                    }

    Channel.from(1,2,30).branch(criteria).set { ch1 }
    Channel.from(10,20,1).branch(criteria).set { ch2 }


.. _operator-choice:

choice
------

.. warning:: The choice operator has been deprecated. Use `branch`_ instead.

The ``choice`` operator allows you to forward the items emitted by a source channel to two 
(or more) output channels, `choosing` one out of them at a time. 

The destination channel is selected by using a :ref:`closure <script-closure>` that must return the `index` number of the channel
where the item has to be sent. The first channel is identified by the index ``0``, the second as ``1`` and so on. 

The following example sends all string items beginning with ``Hello`` into ``queue1``, 
the others into ``queue2``  

::
  
    source = Channel.from 'Hello world', 'Hola', 'Hello John'
    queue1 = Channel.create()
    queue2 = Channel.create()

    source.choice( queue1, queue2 ) { a -> a =~ /^Hello.*/ ? 0 : 1 }

    queue1.view()

See also `branch`_ operator.

 .. _operator-multimap:

multiMap
--------

.. note:: Requires Nextflow version ``19.11.0-edge`` or later.

The multiMap operator allows you to forward the items emitted by a source channel to two
or more output channels mapping each input value as a separate element.

The mapping criteria is defined by specifying a :ref:`closure <script-closure>` that specify the
target channels labelled by a unique identifier followed by an expression statement that
evaluates the value to be assigned to such channel.

For example::

    Channel
        .from(1,2,3,4)
        .multiMap { it ->
            foo: it + 1
            bar: it * it
            }
        .set { result }

     result.foo.view { "foo $it" }
     result.bar.view { "bar $it" }

It prints::

    foo 2
    foo 3
    foo 4
    bar 1
    bar 4
    bar 9


.. tip:: The statement expression can be omitted when the value to be emitted is the same as
  the following one. If you need just need to forward the same value to multiple channel
  you can use the following the shorthand notation showed below.

::

   Channel
        .from(1,2,3)
        .multiMap { it -> foo: bar: it }
        .set { result }

As before creates two channels, however both of them receive the same source items.


.. warning::
  The multi-map evaluation closure must be specified inline, ie. it *cannot* be assigned to a
  variable and passed as argument to the operator, how it can be done with other operators.

To create a multi-map criteria as variable that can be passed as an argument to more than one
``multiMap`` operator use the ``multiMapCriteria`` built-in method as shown below::

    def criteria = multiMapCriteria {
                      small: it < 10
                      large: it > 10
                    }

    Channel.from(1,2,30).multiMap(criteria).set { ch1 }
    Channel.from(10,20,1).multiMap(criteria).set { ch2 }


.. _operator-into:

into
----

.. warning::
    The ``into`` operator is not available when using Nextflow DSL2 syntax.

The ``into`` operator connects a source channel to two or more target channels in such a way the values emitted by
the source channel are copied to the target channels. For example::

   Channel
        .from( 'a', 'b', 'c' )
        .into{ foo; bar }

    foo.view{ "Foo emit: " + it }
    bar.view{ "Bar emit: " + it }

::

    Foo emit: a
    Foo emit: b
    Foo emit: c
    Bar emit: a
    Bar emit: b
    Bar emit: c

.. note:: Note the use in this example of curly brackets and the ``;`` as channel names separator. This is needed
  because the actual parameter of ``into`` is a :ref:`closure <script-closure>` which defines the target channels
  to which the source one is connected.

A second version of the ``into`` operator takes an integer `n` as an argument and returns
a list of `n` channels, each of which emits a copy of the items that were emitted by the
source channel. For example::


    (foo, bar) = Channel.from( 'a','b','c').into(2)
    foo.view{ "Foo emit: " + it }
    bar.view{ "Bar emit: " + it }


.. note:: The above example takes advantage of the :ref:`multiple assignment <script-multiple-assignment>` syntax
  in order to assign two variables at once using the list of channels returned by the ``into`` operator.

See also `tap`_ and `separate`_ operators.


tap
---

The ``tap`` operator combines the functions of `into`_ and `separate`_ operators in such a way that
it connects two channels, copying the values from the source into the `tapped` channel. At the same
time it splits the source channel into a newly created channel that is returned by the operator itself.

The ``tap`` can be useful in certain scenarios where you may be required to concatenate multiple operations,
as in the following example::


    log1 = Channel.create()
    log2 = Channel.create()

    Channel
        .of ( 'a', 'b', 'c' )
        .tap ( log1 )
        .map { it * 2 }
        .tap ( log2 )
        .map { it.toUpperCase() }
        .view { "Result: $it" }

    log1.view { "Log 1: $it" }
    log2.view { "Log 2: $it" }

::

    Result: AA
    Result: BB
    Result: CC

    Log 1: a
    Log 1: b
    Log 1: c

    Log 2: aa
    Log 2: bb
    Log 2: cc


The ``tap`` operator also allows the target channel to be specified by using a closure. The advantage of this syntax
is that you won't need to previously create the target channel, because it is created implicitly by the operator itself.

Using the closure syntax the above example can be rewritten as shown below::

    Channel
        .of ( 'a', 'b', 'c' )
        .tap { log1 }
        .map { it * 2 }
        .tap { log2 }
        .map { it.toUpperCase() }
        .view { "Result: $it" }

    log1.view { "Log 1: $it" }
    log2.view { "Log 2: $it" }

See also `into`_ and `separate`_ operators.

.. _operator-separate:

separate
--------

.. warning:: The ``separate`` operator has been deprecated. Use `multiMap`_ instead.

The ``separate`` operator lets you copy the items emitted by the source channel into multiple 
channels, which each of these can receive a `separate` version of the same item. 

The operator applies a `mapping function` of your choosing to every item emitted by the source channel.
This function must return a list of as many values as there are output channels. Each entry in the result 
list will be assigned to the output channel with the corresponding position index. For example:: 

    queue1 = Channel.create()
    queue2 = Channel.create()

    Channel
        .from ( 2,4,8 ) 
        .separate( queue1, queue2 ) { a -> [a+1, a*a] }

    queue1.view { "Channel 1: $it" }
    queue2.view { "Channel 2: $it" }
	
::

	Channel 1: 3
	Channel 2: 4
	Channel 1: 5
	Channel 2: 16
	Channel 2: 64
	Channel 1: 9


When the `mapping function` is omitted, the source channel must emit tuples of values. In this case the operator ``separate``
splits the tuple in such a way that the value `i-th` in a tuple is assigned to the target channel with the corresponding position index.
For example::


     alpha = Channel.create()
     delta = Channel.create()

     Channel
        .from([1,2], ['a','b'], ['p','q'])
        .separate( alpha, delta )

     alpha.view { "first : $it" }
     delta.view { "second: $it" }

It will output::

        first : 1
        first : a
        first : p
        second: 2
        second: b
        second: q

A second version of the ``separate`` operator takes an integer `n` as an argument and returns a list of `n` channels,
each of which gets a value from the corresponding element in the list returned by the closure as explained above.
For example::	

    source = Channel.from(1,2,3)
    (queue1, queue2, queue3) = source.separate(3) { a -> [a, a+1, a*a] }

    queue1.view { "Queue 1 > $it" }
    queue2.view { "Queue 2 > $it" }
    queue3.view { "Queue 3 > $it" }

The output will look like the following fragment::

    Queue 1 > 1
    Queue 1 > 2
    Queue 1 > 3
    Queue 2 > 2
    Queue 2 > 3
    Queue 2 > 4
    Queue 3 > 1
    Queue 3 > 4
    Queue 3 > 9


.. warning:: In the above example, please note that since the ``subscribe`` operator is asynchronous,
  the output of ``channel2`` and ``channel3`` can be printed before the content of ``channel1``.

.. note:: The above example takes advantage of the :ref:`multiple assignment <script-multiple-assignment>` syntax
  in order to assign two variables at once using the list of channels returned by the ``separate`` operator.

Maths operators
================

This section talks about operators that performs maths operations on channels.

The maths operators are:

* `count`_
* `countBy`_
* `min`_
* `max`_
* `sum`_
* `toInteger`_

.. _operator-count:

count
--------

The ``count`` operator creates a channel that emits a single item: a number that represents the total number of
items emitted by the source channel. For example:: 

        Channel
            .from(9,1,7,5)
            .count()
            .view()
        // -> 4


An optional parameter can be provided in order to select which items are to be counted. 
The selection criteria can be specified either as a :ref:`regular expression <script-regexp>`, 
a literal value, a Java class, or a `boolean predicate` that needs to be satisfied. For example::


        Channel
            .from(4,1,7,1,1)
            .count(1)
            .view()
         // -> 3

        Channel
            .from('a','c','c','q','b')
            .count ( ~/c/ )
            .view()
        // -> 2
        
        Channel
            .from('a','c','c','q','b')
            .count { it <= 'c' }
            .view()
        // -> 4


.. _operator-countby:

countBy
----------

The ``countBy`` operator creates a channel which emits an associative array (i.e. ``Map`` object) 
that counts the occurrences of the emitted items in the source channel having the same key. 
For example::

    Channel
        .from( 'x', 'y', 'x', 'x', 'z', 'y' )
        .countBy()
        .view()

::

    [x:3, y:2, z:1]


An optional grouping criteria can be specified by using a :ref:`closure <script-closure>` 
that associates each item with the grouping key. For example::


    Channel
        .from( 'hola', 'hello', 'ciao', 'bonjour', 'halo' )
        .countBy { it[0] }
        .view()


::

    [h:3, c:1, b:1]


.. _operator-min:

min
------

The ``min`` operator waits until the source channel completes, and then emits the item that has the lowest value.
For example::

    Channel
        .from( 8, 6, 2, 5 )
        .min()
        .view { "Min value is $it" }

::

  Min value is 2

An optional :ref:`closure <script-closure>` parameter can be specified in order to provide 
a function that returns the value to be compared. The example below shows how to find the string 
item that has the minimum length:: 

    Channel
    	.from("hello","hi","hey")
    	.min { it.size() } 
    	.view()

::

	 "hi"

Alternatively it is possible to specify a comparator function i.e. a :ref:`closure <script-closure>`
taking two parameters that represent two emitted items to be compared. For example:: 


    Channel
    	.from("hello","hi","hey")
    	.min { a,b -> a.size() <=> b.size() } 
    	.view()


.. _operator-max:

max
------

The ``max`` operator waits until the source channel completes, and then emits the item that has the greatest value.
For example::

    Channel
        .from( 8, 6, 2, 5 )
        .min()
        .view { "Max value is $it" }

::

  Max value is 8


An optional :ref:`closure <script-closure>` parameter can be specified in order to provide 
a function that returns the value to be compared. The example below shows how to find the string 
item that has the maximum length:: 

    Channel
    	.from("hello","hi","hey")
    	.max { it.size() } 
    	.view()

::

	 "hello"

Alternatively it is possible to specify a comparator function i.e. a :ref:`closure <script-closure>`
taking two parameters that represent two emitted items to be compared. For example:: 


    Channel
    	.from("hello","hi","hey")
    	.max { a,b -> a.size() <=> b.size() } 
    	.view()


.. _operator-sum:

sum
------

The ``sum`` operator creates a channel that emits the sum of all the items emitted by the channel itself.
For example::

    Channel
        .from( 8, 6, 2, 5 )
        .sum()
        .view { "The sum is $it" }

::

    The sum is 21


An optional :ref:`closure <script-closure>` parameter can be specified in order to provide 
a function that, given an item, returns the value to be summed. For example:: 

	Channel
		.from( 4, 1, 7, 5 )
		.sum { it * it } 
		.view { "Square: $it" }

::

	Square: 91



toInteger
---------

The ``toInteger`` operator allows you to convert the string values emitted by a channel to ``Integer`` values. For
example::

    Channel
        .from( '1', '7', '12' )
        .toInteger()
        .sum()
        .view()



Other operators
========================

* `close`_
* `dump`_
* `ifEmpty`_
* `print`_
* `println`_
* `set`_
* `view`_

.. _operator-dump:

dump
----

The ``dump`` operator prints the items emitted by the channel to which is applied only when the option
``-dump-channels`` is specified on the ``run`` command line, otherwise it is ignored.

This is useful to enable the debugging of one or more channel content on-demand by using a command line option
instead of modifying your script code.

An optional ``tag`` parameter allows you to select which channel to dump. For example::

    Channel
        .from(1,2,3)
        .map { it+1 }
        .dump(tag:'foo')

    Channel
        .from(1,2,3)
        .map { it^2 }
        .dump(tag: 'bar')


Then you will be able to specify the tag ``foo`` or ``bar`` as an argument of the ``-dump-channels`` option to print
either the content of the first or the second channel. Multiple tag names can be specified separating them with a ``,``
character.


.. _operator-set:

set
----

The ``set`` operator assigns the channel to a variable whose name is specified as a closure parameter.
For example::

    Channel.from(10,20,30).set { my_channel }

This is semantically equivalent to the following assignment::

    my_channel = Channel.from(10,20,30)

However the ``set`` operator is more idiomatic in Nextflow scripting, since it can be used at the end
of a chain of operator transformations, thus resulting in a more fluent and readable operation.

.. _operator-ifempty:

ifEmpty
--------

The ``ifEmpty`` operator creates a channel which emits a default value, specified as the operator parameter, when the channel to which
is applied is *empty* i.e. doesn't emit any value. Otherwise it will emit the same sequence of entries as the original channel.

Thus, the following example prints::

    Channel .from(1,2,3) .ifEmpty('Hello') .view()

    1
    2
    3





Instead, this one prints::

    Channel.empty().ifEmpty('Hello') .view()

    Hello

The ``ifEmpty`` value parameter can be defined with a :ref:`closure <script-closure>`. In this case the result value of the closure evaluation
will be emitted when the empty condition is satisfied.

See also: :ref:`channel-empty` method.

.. _operator-print:

print
------

.. warning::
  The ``print`` operator is deprecated and not supported any more when using DSL2 syntax. Use
  `view`_ instead.

The ``print`` operator prints the items emitted by a channel to the standard output.
An optional :ref:`closure <script-closure>` parameter can be specified to customise how items are printed.
For example::

  Channel
        .from('foo', 'bar', 'baz', 'qux')
        .print { it.toUpperCase() + ' ' }

It prints::

    FOO BAR BAZ QUX

See also: `println`_ and `view`_.

.. _operator-println:

println
--------

.. warning::
  The ``println`` operator is deprecated and not supported any more when using DSL2 syntax. Use
  `view`_ instead.

The ``println`` operator prints the items emitted by a channel to the console standard output appending
a *new line* character to each of them. For example::

  Channel
        .from('foo', 'bar', 'baz', 'qux')
        .println()

It prints::

        foo
        bar
        baz
        qux


An optional closure parameter can be specified to customise how items are printed. For example::

  Channel
        .from('foo', 'bar', 'baz', 'qux')
        .view { "~ $it" }


It prints::

        ~ foo
        ~ bar
        ~ baz
        ~ qux

See also: `print`_ and `view`_.

.. _operator-view:

view
------

The ``view`` operator prints the items emitted by a channel to the console standard output. For example::

    Channel.from(1,2,3).view()

    1
    2
    3

Each item is printed on a separate line unless otherwise specified by using the ``newLine: false`` optional parameter.

How the channel items are printed can be controlled by using an optional closure parameter. The closure it must return
the actual value of the item being to be printed::

    Channel.from(1,2,3)
            .map { it -> [it, it*it] }
            .view { num, sqr -> "Square of: $num is $sqr" }

It prints::

    Square of: 1 is 1
    Square of: 2 is 4
    Square of: 3 is 9


.. note:: Both the *view* and `print`_ (or `println`_) operators consume them items emitted by the source channel to which they
    are applied. However, the main difference between them is that the former returns a newly create channel whose content
    is identical to the source one. This allows the *view* operator to be chained like other operators.

.. _operator-close:

close
------

The ``close`` operator sends a termination signal over the channel, causing downstream processes or operators to stop.
In a common usage scenario channels are closed automatically by Nextflow, so you won't need to use this operator explicitly.

See also: :ref:`channel-empty` factory method.
