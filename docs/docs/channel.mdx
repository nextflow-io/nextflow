# Dataflow

Nextflow uses a **dataflow** programming model to define workflows declaratively. In this model, [processes][process-page] in a pipeline are connected to each other through *dataflow channels* and *dataflow values*.

## Channels

A *dataflow channel* (or simply *channel*) is an asynchronous sequence of values.

The values in a channel cannot be accessed directly, but only through an operator or process. For example:

```nextflow
channel.of(1, 2, 3).view { v -> "channel emits ${v}" }
```

```console
channel emits 1
channel emits 2
channel emits 3
```

### Factories

A channel can be created by factories in the `channel` namespace. For example, the `channel.fromPath()` factory creates a channel from a file name or glob pattern, similar to the `files()` function:

```nextflow
channel.fromPath('input/*.txt').view()
```

See [Channel factories][channel-factory] for the full list of channel factories.

### Operators

Channel operators, or *operators* for short, are functions that consume and produce channels. Because channels are asynchronous, operators are necessary to manipulate the values in a channel. Operators are particularly useful for implementing glue logic between processes.

Commonly used operators include:

- [combine][operator-combine]: emit the combinations of two channels
- [collect][operator-collect]: collect the values from a channel into a list
- [filter][operator-filter]: select the values in a channel that satisfy a condition
- [flatMap][operator-flatMap]: transform each value from a channel into a list and emit each list element separately
- [groupTuple][operator-grouptuple]: group the values from a channel based on a grouping key
- [join][operator-join]: join the values from two channels based on a matching key
- [map][operator-map]: transform each value from a channel with a mapping function
- [mix][operator-mix]: emit the values from multiple channels
- [view][operator-view]: print each value in a channel to standard output

See [Operators][operator-page] for the full list of operators.

## Values

A *dataflow value* is an asynchronous value.

Dataflow values can be created using the [value][channel-value] factory, and they are created by processes (under [certain conditions][process-out-singleton]).

A dataflow value cannot be accessed directly, but only through an operator or process. For example:

```nextflow
channel.value(1).view { v -> "dataflow value is ${v}" }
```

```console
dataflow value is 1
```

See [Value][stdlib-types-value] for the set of available methods for dataflow values.
