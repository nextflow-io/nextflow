Nextflow provides out-of-the-box support for the `Google Cloud Platform <https://cloud.google.com/>`_
enabling the seamless deployment and execution of Nextflow pipelines over Google cloud services.

The execution can be done either deploying a Nextflow managed cluster using `Google Compute Engine <https://cloud.google.com/compute/>`_
instances or via the `Genomics Pipelines <https://cloud.google.com/genomics/>`_ managed service.

.. note::
    This feature requires Nextflow version 19.01.0 or later.

.. warning::
    This feature is deprecated in favour of :ref:`google-lifesciences` executor.

Requirements
============

Nextflow
--------
The support for Google Cloud requires Nextflow version ``19.01.0``. To install it define the following variables
in your system environment::

    export NXF_VER=19.01.0
    export NXF_MODE=google

Then run the following command::

    curl https://get.nextflow.io | bash

Complete the installation copying the ``nextflow`` launcher script in a directory in your system ``PATH`` (optional).


Credentials
-----------

To allow the deployment in the Google Cloud you need to configure the security credentials using
a *Security account key* JSON file.

Nextflow looks for this file using the ``GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`` variable that
has to be defined in the launching environment.

If you don't have it, download the credentials file from the Google Cloud Console following these steps:

* Open the `Google Cloud Console <https://console.cloud.google.com>`_
* Go to APIs & Services â†’ Credentials
* Click on the *Create credentials* (blue) drop-down and choose *Service account key*, in the following page
* Select an existing *Service account* or create a new one if needed
* Select JSON as *Key type*
* Click the *Create* button and download the JSON file giving a name of your choice e.g. ``creds.json``.

Finally define the following variable replacing the path in the example with the one of your
credentials file just downloaded::

    export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/your/file/creds.json


Compute Engine
==============

When using this feature Nextflow allows you set up an ephemeral computing cluster in the Google Cloud platform
and use it to deploy your pipeline execution.

Configuration
-------------

Cloud configuration attributes are provided in the ``nextflow.config`` file as shown in the example below::

    cloud {
        driver = 'google'
        imageId = 'rare-lattice-222412/global/images/seqvm-1'
        instanceType = 'n1-highcpu-8'
    }

    google {
        project = 'your-project-id'
        zone = 'us-central1-f'
    }

The above attributes define the image ID and instance type to be used along with the project and zone to be used.
Replace these values with the ones of your choice.

.. tip:: Make sure to specify the ``google`` as cloud driver value as shown in the above example.

Nextflow requires a Linux image that provides support for `Cloud-init <http://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/>`_
bootstrapping mechanism and includes the Java runtime (version 8 or later) and the Docker engine (version 1.11 or later).

The very first time you will need to create a custom machine image containing these two software packages and use it
to deploy your pipeline execution.

Refer to the Google cloud documentation to learn `how to create a custom image <https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images/create-delete-deprecate-private-images>`_.

User & SSH key management
-------------------------

By default Nextflow creates in each GCE instance a user with the same name as the one in your local computer and install
the SSH public key available at the path ``$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub``.

A different user/key can be specified as shown below::

    cloud {
        driver = 'google'
        userName = 'the-user-name'
        keyFile = '/path/to/ssh/key.pub'
    }

Storage
-------

Both input data and the pipeline work directory must be located in one or more `Google Storage <https://cloud.google.com/storage/>`_ buckets.
Make sure your security credentials allows you to access these buckets.

Cluster deployment
------------------

Once you have defined the configuration settings in the ``nextflow.config`` file you can create the cloud cluster by
using the following command::

    nextflow cloud create my-cluster -c <num-of-nodes>

The string ``my-cluster`` identifies the cluster instance. Replace it with a name of your choice.

Finally replace ``<num-of-nodes>`` with the actual number of instances that will make-up the cluster. One node is
created as master, the remaining as workers. If the option ``-c`` is omitted only the **master** node is created.

.. warning:: You will be charged accordingly the type and the number of instances chosen.

The console will display the configuration that you have defined and ask you to confirm creation of the cluster with the
configuration displayed. It will take some time for the cluster to deploy. You should be able to track the status of the
deployed in the administration console for the Google Cloud Platform under VM instances in the Compute Engine section.


Pipeline execution
------------------

Once the master node is available, Nextflow will display the SSH command to connect to the master node. Use
that command to connect to the cluster.

.. note:: On MacOS, use the following command to avoid being asked for a pass-phrase even
  you haven't defined one::

    ssh-add -K [private key file]

The suggested approach is to run your pipeline downloading it from a public repository such as GitHub and to pack the
binaries dependencies in a Docker container as described in the :ref:`Pipeline sharing <sharing-page>` section.

.. warning:: Before running any Nextflow command, make sure the file ``READY`` has been created in the home directory.
  If you can't find it, it means that the initialisation process is still on-going. Wait a few seconds until it completes.

Then, you can run Nextflow as usual. For example::

    ./nextflow run rnaseq-nf -profile gcp -work-dir gs://my-bucket/work


.. tip:: Make sure to specify a Google Storage path, containing at a bucket sub-directory, as the Nextflow work directory
  and as a location for pipeline input data.

.. note:: The ``nextflow`` launcher script is created in the instance ``HOME`` directory.

Cluster shutdown
----------------

When completed, shutdown the cluster instances by using the following command::

    nextflow cloud shutdown my-cluster

Replace ``my-cluster`` with the name used in your execution.

Preemptible instances 
---------------------

An optional parameter allows you to set the instance to be preemptible. Both master and worker instances can be set to
be preemptible. The following example shows a cluster configuration with a preemptible setting::

    cloud {
        imageId = 'rare-lattice-222412/global/images/seqvm-1'
        instanceType = 'n1-highcpu-8'
        preemptible = true
    }

Setting an instance to preemptible allows the administrator to kill the VM at will and may affect the pricing of the
instance.

Cluster auto-scaling
--------------------

Nextflow integration for Google Cloud Engine provides a native support auto-scaling that allows the computing cluster
to scale up or scale down i.e., add or remove computing nodes dynamically at runtime.

This is a critical feature, especially for pipelines crunching non-homogeneous datasets, because it allows the cluster
to adapt dynamically to the actual workload computing resources needed as they change over time.

Cluster auto-scaling is enabled by adding the autoscale option group in the configuration file as shown below::

    cloud {
        imageId = 'rare-lattice-222412/global/images/seqvm-1'
        autoscale {
            enabled = true
            maxInstances = 10
        }
    }


The above example enables automatic cluster scale-out i.e. new instances are automatically launched and added to the
cluster when tasks remain too long in wait status because there aren't enough computing resources available. The
``maxInstances`` attribute defines the upper limit to which the cluster can grow.

By default unused instances are not removed when they are not utilised. If you want to enable automatic cluster scale-down
specify the ``terminateWhenIdle`` attribute in the ``autoscale`` configuration group.

It is also possible to define a different machine image IDs, type and spot price for instances launched by the Nextflow
autoscaler. For example::

    cloud {
        imageId = 'your-project/global/images/xxx'
        instanceType = 'n1-highcpu-8'
        preemptible = false
        autoscale {
            enable = true
            preemptible = true
            minInstances = 5
            maxInstances = 10
            imageId = 'your-project/global/images/yyy'
            instanceType = 'n1-highcpu-8'
            terminateWhenIdle = true
        }
    }

By doing so it is possible to create a cluster with a single node i.e. the master node. The autoscaler will then
automatically add the missing instances, up to the number defined by the ``minInstances`` attributes. 


Limitation
----------

* Pipeline input data must and work directory must be located on `Google Storage <https://cloud.google.com/storage/>`_.
  Other local or remote data sources are not supported at this time.

* The compute nodes local storage is the default assigned by the Compute Engine service for the chosen machine (instance) type.
  Currently it is not possible to specify a custom disk size for local storage.


Advanced configuration
----------------------

Read :ref:`Cloud configuration<config-cloud>` section to learn more about advanced cloud configuration options.


.. _google-pipelines:

Genomics Pipelines
==================

.. warning::
  The support for Google Pipelines API is deprecated. The `google-lifesciences`_ instead.

`Genomics Pipelines <https://cloud.google.com/genomics/>`_ is a managed computing service that allows the execution of
containerized workloads in the Google Cloud Platform infrastructure.

Nextflow provides built-in support for Genomics Pipelines API which allows the seamless deployment of a Nextflow pipeline
in the cloud, offloading the process executions through the Pipelines service.

.. warning:: This API works well for coarse-grained workloads i.e. long running jobs. It's not suggested the use
  this feature for pipelines spawning many short lived tasks.

.. _google-pipelines-config:

Configuration
-------------

Make sure to have defined in your environment the ``GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`` variable.
See the section `Requirements`_ for details.

.. tip:: Make sure to have enabled Genomics API to use this feature. To learn how to enable it
  follow `this link <https://cloud.google.com/genomics/docs/quickstart>`_.

Create a ``nextflow.config`` file in the project root directory. The config must specify the following parameters:

* Google Pipelines as Nextflow executor i.e. ``process.executor = 'google-pipelines'``.
* The Docker container images to be used to run pipeline tasks e.g. ``process.container = 'biocontainers/salmon:0.8.2--1'``.
* The Google Cloud `project` ID to run in e.g. ``google.project = 'rare-lattice-222412'``.
* The Google Cloud `region` or `zone`. You need to specify either one, **not** both. Multiple regions or zones can be
  specified by separating them with a comma e.g. ``google.zone = 'us-central1-f,us-central-1-b'``.

Example::

    process {
        executor = 'google-pipelines'
        container = 'your/container:latest'
    }

    google {
        project = 'your-project-id'
        zone = 'europe-west1-b'
    }


.. warning:: Make sure to specify in the above setting the project ID not the project name.

.. Note:: A container image must be specified to deploy the process execution. You can use a different Docker image for
  each process using one or more :ref:`config-process-selectors`. 

Process definition
------------------
Processes can be defined as usual and by default the ``cpus`` and ``memory`` directives are used to instantiate a custom
machine type with the specified compute resources.  If ``memory`` is not specified, 1GB of memory is allocated per cpu.
A persistent disk will be created with size corresponding to the ``disk`` directive.  If ``disk`` is not specified, the
instance default is chosen to ensure reasonable I/O performance.

The process ``machineType`` directive may optionally be used to specify a predefined Google Compute Platform `machine type <https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-types>`_
If specified, this value overrides the ``cpus`` and ``memory`` directives.
If the ``cpus`` and ``memory`` directives are used, the values must comply with the allowed custom machine type `specifications <https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/creating-instance-with-custom-machine-type#specifications>`_ .  Extended memory is not directly supported, however high memory or cpu predefined
instances may be utilized using the ``machineType`` directive

Examples::

    process custom_resources_task {
        cpus 8
        memory '40 GB'
        disk '200 GB'

        """
        <Your script here>
        """
    }

    process predefined_resources_task {
        machineType 'n1-highmem-8'

        """
        <Your script here>
        """
    }

.. note:: This feature requires Nextflow 19.07.0 or later.

Pipeline execution
------------------

The pipeline can be launched either in a local computer or a cloud instance. Pipeline input data can be stored either
locally or in a Google Storage bucket.

The pipeline execution must specify a Google Storage bucket where the workflow's intermediate results are stored using
the ``-work-dir`` command line options. For example::

    nextflow run <script or project name> -work-dir gs://my-bucket/some/path


.. tip:: Any input data **not** stored in a Google Storage bucket will automatically be transferred to the
  pipeline work bucket. Use this feature with caution being careful to avoid unnecessary data transfers.

Hybrid execution
----------------

Nextflow allows the use of multiple executors in the same workflow application. This feature enables the deployment
of hybrid workloads in which some jobs are executed in the local computer or local computing cluster and
some other jobs are offloaded to Google Pipelines service.

To enable this feature use one or more :ref:`config-process-selectors` in your Nextflow configuration file to apply
the Google Pipelines *executor* only to a subset of processes in your workflow.
For example::


    process {
        withLabel: bigTask {
            executor = 'google-pipelines'
            container = 'my/image:tag'
        }
    }

    google {
        project = 'your-project-id'
        zone = 'europe-west1-b'
    }


Then deploy the workflow execution using the ``-bucket-dir`` to specify a Google Storage path
for the jobs computed by the Google Pipeline service and, optionally, the ``-work-dir`` to
specify the local storage for the jobs computed locally::

    nextflow run <script or project name> -bucket-dir gs://my-bucket/some/path

.. warning:: The Google Storage path needs to contain at least sub-directory. Don't use only the
  bucket name e.g. ``gs://my-bucket``. 

Limitation
----------

* Currently it's not possible to specify a disk type different from the default one assigned
  by the service depending the chosen instance type.


Troubleshooting
---------------

* Make sure to have enabled Compute Engine API, Genomics API and Cloud Storage Service in the
  `APIs & Services Dashboard <https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard>`_ page.

* Make sure to have enough compute resources to run your pipeline in your project
  `Quotas <https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/quotas>`_ (i.e. Compute Engine CPUs,
  Compute Engine Persistent Disk, Compute Engine In-use IP addresses, etc).

* Make sure your security credentials allows you to access any Google Storage bucket
  where input data and temporary files are stored.

Google Pipelines debugging information can be enabled using the ``-trace`` command line option
as shown below::

    nextflow -trace nextflow.cloud.google.pipelines run <your_project_or_script_name>


.. _google-lifesciences:

Cloud Life Sciences
===================

`Cloud Life Sciences <https://cloud.google.com/life-sciences/>`_ is a managed computing service that allows the execution of
containerized workloads in the Google Cloud Platform infrastructure.

Nextflow provides built-in support for Cloud Life Sciences API which allows the seamless deployment of a Nextflow pipeline
in the cloud, offloading the process executions through the Google Cloud service.

.. note::
  This features requires Nextflow ``20.01.0-edge`` or later.

.. warning::
  This API works well for coarse-grained workloads i.e. long running jobs. It's not suggested the use
  this feature for pipelines spawning many short lived tasks.

.. _google-lifesciences-config:

Configuration
-------------

Make sure to have defined in your environment the ``GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`` variable.
See the section `Requirements`_ for details.

.. tip:: Make sure to have enabled Cloud Life Sciences API to use this feature. To learn how to enable it
  follow `this link <https://cloud.google.com/life-sciences/docs/quickstart>`_.

Create a ``nextflow.config`` file in the project root directory. The config must specify the following parameters:

* Google Life Sciences as Nextflow executor i.e. ``process.executor = 'google-lifesciences'``.
* The Docker container images to be used to run pipeline tasks e.g. ``process.container = 'biocontainers/salmon:0.8.2--1'``.
* The Google Cloud `project` ID to run in e.g. ``google.project = 'rare-lattice-222412'``.
* The Google Cloud `region` or `zone`. This is where the Compute Engine VMs will be started.
  You need to specify either one, **not** both. Multiple regions or zones can be specified by
  separating them with a comma e.g. ``google.zone = 'us-central1-f,us-central-1-b'``.

Example::

    process {
        executor = 'google-lifesciences'
        container = 'your/container:latest'
    }

    google {
        project = 'your-project-id'
        zone = 'europe-west1-b'
    }


.. warning:: Make sure to specify in the above setting the project ID not the project name.

.. Note:: A container image must be specified to deploy the process execution. You can use a different Docker image for
  each process using one or more :ref:`config-process-selectors`.

The following configuration options are available:

======================================= =================
Name                                    Description
======================================= =================
google.project                          The Google Project Id to use for the pipeline execution.
google.region                           The Google *region* where the computation is executed in Compute Engine VMs. Multiple regions can be provided separating them by a comma. Do not specify if a zone is provided. See  `available Compute Engine regions and zones <https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones/>`_
google.zone                             The Google *zone* where the computation is executed in Compute Engine VMs. Multiple zones can be provided separating them by a comma. Do not specify if a region is provided. See  `available Compute Engine regions and zones <https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones/>`_
google.location                         The Google *location* where the job executions are deployed to Cloud Life Sciences API. See  `available Cloud Life Sciences API locations <https://cloud.google.com/life-sciences/docs/concepts/locations>`_ (default: the same as the region or the zone specified).
google.lifeSciences.bootDiskSize        Set the size of the virtual machine boot disk e.g `50.GB` (default: none).
google.lifeSciences.copyImage           The container image run to copy input and output files. It must include the ``gsutil`` tool (default: ``google/cloud-sdk:alpine``).
google.lifeSciences.debug               When ``true`` copies the `/google` debug directory in that task bucket directory (defualt: ``false``)
google.lifeSciences.preemptible         When ``true`` enables the usage of *preemptible* virtual machines or ``false`` otherwise (default: ``true``)
google.lifeSciences.usePrivateAddress   When ``true`` the VM will NOT be provided with a public IP address, and only contain an internal IP. If this option is enabled, the associated job can only load docker images from Google Container Registry, and the job executable cannot use external services other than Google APIs (default: ``false``). Requires version `20.03.0-edge` or later.
google.lifeSciences.sshDaemon           When ``true`` runs SSH daemon in the VM carrying out the job to which it's possible to connect for debugging purposes (default: ``false``).
google.lifeSciences.sshImage            The container image used to run the SSH daemon (default: ``gcr.io/cloud-genomics-pipelines/tools``).
======================================= =================


Process definition
------------------
Processes can be defined as usual and by default the ``cpus`` and ``memory`` directives are used to instantiate a custom
machine type with the specified compute resources.  If ``memory`` is not specified, 1GB of memory is allocated per cpu.
A persistent disk will be created with size corresponding to the ``disk`` directive.  If ``disk`` is not specified, the

If specified, this value overrides the ``cpus`` and ``memory`` directives.
If the ``cpus`` and ``memory`` directives are used, the values must comply with the allowed custom machine type `specifications <https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/creating-instance-with-custom-machine-type#specifications>`_ .  Extended memory is not directly supported, however high memory or cpu predefined
instances may be utilized using the ``machineType`` directive

Examples::

    process custom_resources_task {
        cpus 8
        memory '40 GB'
        disk '200 GB'

        """
        <Your script here>
        """
    }

    process predefined_resources_task {
        machineType 'n1-highmem-8'

        """
        <Your script here>
        """
    }

.. note:: This feature requires Nextflow 19.07.0 or later.

Pipeline execution
------------------

The pipeline can be launched either in a local computer or a cloud instance. Pipeline input data can be stored either
locally or in a Google Storage bucket.

The pipeline execution must specify a Google Storage bucket where the workflow's intermediate results are stored using
the ``-work-dir`` command line options. For example::

    nextflow run <script or project name> -work-dir gs://my-bucket/some/path


.. tip:: Any input data **not** stored in a Google Storage bucket will automatically be transferred to the
  pipeline work bucket. Use this feature with caution being careful to avoid unnecessary data transfers.

Preemptible instances
---------------------

Preemptible instances are supported adding the following setting in the Nextflow config file::

    google {
        lifeSciences.preemptible = true
    }

Since this type of virtual machines can be retired by the provider before the job completion, it is advisable
to add the following retry strategy to your config file to instruct Nextflow to automatically re-execute a job
if the virtual machine was terminated preemptively::

    process {
      errorStrategy = { task.exitStatus==14 ? 'retry' : 'terminate' }
      maxRetries = 5
    }


Hybrid execution
----------------

Nextflow allows the use of multiple executors in the same workflow application. This feature enables the deployment
of hybrid workloads in which some jobs are executed in the local computer or local computing cluster and
some other jobs are offloaded to Google Pipelines service.

To enable this feature use one or more :ref:`config-process-selectors` in your Nextflow configuration file to apply
the Google Pipelines *executor* only to a subset of processes in your workflow.
For example::


    process {
        withLabel: bigTask {
            executor = 'google-lifesciences'
            container = 'my/image:tag'
        }
    }

    google {
        project = 'your-project-id'
        zone = 'europe-west1-b'
    }


Then deploy the workflow execution using the ``-bucket-dir`` to specify a Google Storage path
for the jobs computed by the Google Pipeline service and, optionally, the ``-work-dir`` to
specify the local storage for the jobs computed locally::

    nextflow run <script or project name> -bucket-dir gs://my-bucket/some/path

.. warning:: The Google Storage path needs to contain at least sub-directory. Don't use only the
  bucket name e.g. ``gs://my-bucket``.

Limitation
----------

* Currently it's not possible to specify a disk type different from the default one assigned
  by the service depending the chosen instance type.



Troubleshooting
---------------

* Make sure to have enabled Compute Engine API, Life Sciences API and Cloud Storage Service in the
  `APIs & Services Dashboard <https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard>`_ page.

* Make sure to have enough compute resources to run your pipeline in your project
  `Quotas <https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/quotas>`_ (i.e. Compute Engine CPUs,
  Compute Engine Persistent Disk, Compute Engine In-use IP addresses, etc).

* Make sure your security credentials allows you to access any Google Storage bucket
  where input data and temporary files are stored.

* Check the directory ``google/`` created in the task work directory (in the bucket storage) created
  when on job failure and containing useful information of the job execution. The creation
  can be enabled as default setting the option ``google.lifeSciences.debug = true`` in the
  Nextflow config file

* Enable the optional SSH daemon in the job VM using the option ``google.lifeSciences.sshDaemon = true``

* Make sure you are choosing a `location` where  `Cloud Life Sciences API is available <https://cloud.google.com/life-sciences/docs/concepts/locations>`_, 
  and a `region` or `zone` where `Compute Engine is available <https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones/>`_.
