As of version ``21.09.0-edge``, Nextflow adds the built-in support for pipeline secrets to allow users to handle
and manage sensitive information for pipeline execution in a safe manner.

How it works
============

This feature allows decoupling the use secrets in your pipelines from the pipeline code and configuration files.
Secrets are instead managed by Nextflow and store separately into a local store only accessible to the secrets
owner.

When the pipeline execution is launched Nextflow inject the secrets in pipeline jobs without leaking them
into temporary execution files. The secrets are accessible into the job command via environment variables.


Command line
============

Nextflow provides a command named ``secrets``. This command allows four simple
operations:

===================== =====================
Operation               Description
===================== =====================
``list``                List secrets available in the current store e.g. ``nextflow secrets list``.
``get``                 Allows retrieving a secret value e.g. ``nextflow secrets get FOO``.
``set``                 Allows creating a new secret or overriding an existing one e.g. ``nextflow secrets set FOO "Hello world"``
``delete``              Allows deleting an existing secret e.g. ``nextflow secrets delete FOO``.
===================== =====================

Configuration file
==================

Once create the secrets can be used in the pipeline configuration file as implicit variables using the ``secrets`` scope::

    aws {
      accessKey = secrets.MY_ACCESS_KEY
      secretKey = secrets.MY_SECRET_KEY
    }

The above snippet access the secrets ``MY_ACCESS_KEY`` and ``MY_SECRET_KEY`` previously and assign them to
the corresponding AWS credentials settings.

.. warning::
    Secrets **cannot** be assigned to pipeline parameters.


Process secrets
===============

Secrets can be access by pipeline processes by using the ``secret`` directive. For example::

    process someJob {
        secret 'MY_ACCESS_KEY'
        secret 'MY_SECRET_KEY'

        """
        your_command --access \$MY_ACCESS_KEY --secret \$MY_SECRET_KEY
        """
    }

The above snippet runs a command in with the variables ``MY_ACCESS_KEY`` and ``MY_SECRET_KEY`` are injected in the
process execution environment holding the values defines in the secret store.

.. warning::
    The secrets are made available in the process context running the command script as environment variables.
    Therefore make sure to escape the variable name identifier with a backslash as shown
    in the example above, otherwise a variable with the same will be evaluated in the Nextflow script
    context instead of the command script.

.. note::
    This feature is only available when using the local or grid executors (Slurm, Grid Engine, etc).
    The AWS Batch executor allows the use of secrets when deploying the pipeline execution via
