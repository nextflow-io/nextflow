# Plugins

## Main concepts

Nextflow is based on a plugins system that allows extending core functionalities via pluggable components that are download and installed at runtime.

Currently the following functionalities are implemented as plugin components and they make part of the Nextflow *default* plugins:

- `nf-amazon`: Support for Amazon cloud.
- `nf-azure`: Support for Azure cloud.
- `nf-console`: Implement Nextflow [REPL console](https://www.nextflow.io/blog/2015/introducing-nextflow-console.html).
- `nf-ga4gh`: Support [GA4GH APIs](https://www.ga4gh.org/).
- `nf-google`: Support for Google cloud.
- `nf-tower`: Support for [Nextflow Tower](https://tower.nf) platform.

## Configuration

Nextflow *default* plugins do not require any configuration. They are automatically installed when the corresponding feature is requested by a Nextflow pipeline.

To use **non-default** plugins in your pipeline execution, you must declare them in the Nextflow configuration file, listing each plugin as shown below:

```groovy
plugins {
  id 'nf-hello@0.1.0'
}
```

The plugin identifier consists of the plugin name and plugin version separated by a `@`.

Alternatively, plugins can be required using the `-plugins` command line option:

```bash
nextflow run <PIPELINE NAME> -plugins nf-hello@0.1.0
```

Multiple plugins can be specified by separating them with a comma. When specifying plugins via the command line, any plugin declarations in the Nextflow config file are ignored.

## Index

Nextflow resolves plugins download location through the [Plugins index](https://github.com/nextflow-io/plugins/). The index stores for each plugin the available version, the creation date, checksum and the link from where the plugin file is downloaded.

To add a new plugin to the Index, create a pull request including the request plugin metadata. The [nf-hello](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nf-hello) repository provides a minimal code example for the implementation of a Nextflow plugin.

## Import operators from plugin

:::{versionadded} 22.04.0
:::

Nextflow supports the inclusion of custom operators from Nextflow plugins.

For example:

```groovy
include { sqlInsert; fromQuery as selectFromTable } from 'plugin/nf-sqldb'

def sql = "select * from FOO"
channel
    .selectFromTable(sql, db: "test", emitColumns:true)
    .sqlInsert(into:"BAR", columns:'id', db:"test")
```

The above snippet includes the operators `sqlInsert` and `fromQuery` from the [nf-sqldb](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nf-sqldb) plugin. The latter will be accessible using the `selectFromTable` alias in the script.

:::{note}
The prefix `plugin/` must precede the plugin name in the include `from` statement.

## Import custom functions from plugin

:::{versionadded} 22.09.0-edge
:::

Nextflow supports the inclusion of custom functions from Nextflow plugins.

For example, a plugin can export a util function to reverse a String:

```groovy
@nextflow.plugin.extension.Function
String reverseString( String origin ){
     origin.reverse()
}
```

And this function can be used by the pipeline:

```groovy
include { reverseString } from 'plugin/my-plugin'

channel.of( reverseString('hi') )
```

The above snippet includes a function from the plugin and allows the channel to call it directly.

In the same way as operators, functions can be aliased:

```groovy
include { reverseString as anotherReverseMethod } from 'plugin/my-plugin'
```

## Testing custom plugins

To make a plugin available to Nextflow, it needs to be included in the [plugins repository index](https://github.com/nextflow-io/plugins).

However, in order to validate a plugin before it's published in the repository index, it is possible to use the environment
variable `NXF_PLUGINS_TEST_REPOSITORY` to specify the URI of a custom index JSON file or the plugin JSON meta file.

For example:

```bash
export NXF_PLUGINS_TEST_REPOSITORY="https://github.com/nextflow-io/nf-hello/releases/download/0.3.0/nf-hello-0.3.0-meta.json"
```

Then run Nextflow with the expected plugin:

```bash
nextflow rub <your script> -plugins nf-hello
```
