## Enhancements

<h3>New syntax for workflow handlers</h3>

The workflow `onComplete` and `onError` handlers were previously defined by calling `workflow.onComplete` and `workflow.onError` in the pipeline script. You can now define handlers as `onComplete` and `onError` sections in an entry workflow:

```nextflow
workflow {
    main:
    // ...

    onComplete:
    println "workflow complete"

    onError:
    println "error: ${workflow.errorMessage}"
}
```

This syntax is simpler and easier to use with the [strict syntax][strict-syntax-page]. See [Workflow handlers][workflow-handlers] for details.

## Breaking changes

- The AWS Java SDK used by Nextflow was upgraded from v1 to v2, which introduced some breaking changes to the `aws.client` config options. See [AWS Java SDK v2][aws-java-sdk-v2-page] for details.

## Deprecations

- The use of workflow handlers in the configuration file has been deprecated. You should define workflow handlers in the pipeline script or a plugin instead. See [Workflow handlers][config-workflow-handlers] for details.
