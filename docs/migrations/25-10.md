## Enhancements

<h3>New syntax for workflow handlers</h3>

The workflow `onComplete` and `onError` handlers were previously defined by calling `workflow.onComplete` and `workflow.onError` in the pipeline script. You can now define handlers as `onComplete` and `onError` sections in an entry workflow:

```nextflow
workflow {
    main:
    // ...

    onComplete:
    println "workflow complete"

    onError:
    println "error: ${workflow.errorMessage}"
}
```

This syntax is simpler and easier to use with the {ref}`strict syntax <strict-syntax-page>`. See {ref}`workflow-handlers` for details.

<h3>Improved handling of dynamic directives</h3>

The {ref}`strict syntax <strict-syntax-page>` allows dynamic process directives to be specified without a closure:

```nextflow
process hello {
    queue (entries > 100 ? 'long' : 'short')

    input:
    tuple val(entries), path('data.txt')

    script:
    """
    your_command --here
    """
}
```

See {ref}`dynamic-directives` for details.

<h3>Configurable date formatting</h3>

You can now customize the date and time format used in notifications, reports, and console output using the `NXF_DATE_FORMAT` environment variable:

```bash
# Default format
# e.g., 11-Aug-2016 09:40:20

# Use ISO format with timezone
export NXF_DATE_FORMAT="iso"
# e.g., 2016-08-11T09:40:20+02:00

# Use custom format
export NXF_DATE_FORMAT="yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm"
# e.g., 2016-08-11 09:40
```

This feature addresses previous inconsistencies in timestamp representations.

## Breaking changes

- The AWS Java SDK used by Nextflow was upgraded from v1 to v2, which introduced some breaking changes to the `aws.client` config options. See {ref}`the guide <aws-java-sdk-v2-page>` for details.

## Deprecations

- The use of workflow handlers in the configuration file has been deprecated. You should define workflow handlers in the pipeline script or a plugin instead. See {ref}`config-workflow-handlers` for details.
