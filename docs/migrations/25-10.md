# Migrating to 25.10 (preview)

This page summarizes the upcoming changes in Nextflow 25.10, which will be released in October 2025.

:::{note}
This page is a work in progress and will be updated as features are finalized. It should not be considered complete until the 25.10 release.

## New features

<h3>Workflow params</h3>

The `params` block is a new way to declare pipeline parameters in a Nextflow script:

```nextflow
params {
  // Path to input data.
  input: Path

  // Whether to save intermediate files.
  save_intermeds: Boolean = false
}

workflow {
  println "params.input = ${params.input}"
  println "params.save_intermeds = ${params.save_intermeds}"
}
```

This syntax allows you to declare all parameters in one place with explicit type annotations, and it allows Nextflow to validate parameters at runtime.

See {ref}`workflow-params-def` for details.

<h3>Type annotations</h3>

Type annotations are a way to denote the *type* of a variable. They help document and validate pipeline code.

```nextflow
workflow RNASEQ {
  take:
  reads: Channel<Path>
  index: Value<Path>

  main:
  samples_ch = QUANT( reads, index )

  emit:
  samples: Channel<Path> = samples_ch
}

def isSraId(id: String) -> Boolean {
  return id.startsWith('SRA')
}
```

The following declarations can be annotated with types:

- Pipeline parameters (the `params` block)
- Workflow takes and emits
- Function parameters and returns
- Local variables
- Closure parameters
- Workflow outputs (the `output` block)

Type annotations can refer to any of the {ref}`standard types <stdlib-types>`.

Type annotations can be appended with `?` to denote that the value can be `null`:

```nextflow
def x_opt: String? = null
```

In the type system, queue channels are represented as `Channel`, while value channels are represented as `Value`. To make the terminology clearer and more concise, queue channels are now called *dataflow channels* (or simply *channels*), and value channels are now called *dataflow values*. See {ref}`dataflow-page` for more information.

:::{note}
Nextflow supports Groovy-style type annotations using the `<type> <name>` syntax, but this approach is deprecated in {ref}`strict syntax <strict-syntax-page>`. While Groovy-style annotations remain valid for functions and local variables, the language server and `nextflow lint` automatically convert them to Nextflow-style annotations during code formatting.

## Enhancements

<h3>Nextflow plugin registry</h3>

Nextflow now uses the [Nextflow plugin registry](https://registry.nextflow.io/) to download plugins in a more efficient and scalable manner.

The legacy plugin index can still be used by setting the `NXF_PLUGINS_REGISTRY_URL` environment variable:

```bash
export NXF_PLUGINS_REGISTRY_URL="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nextflow-io/plugins/main/plugins.json"
```

:::{note}
Plugin developers will not be able to submit PRs to the legacy plugin index once the plugin registry is generally available. Plugins should be updated to publish to the Nextflow plugin registry using the {ref}`Nextflow Gradle plugin <gradle-plugin-page>` instead. See {ref}`migrate-plugin-registry-page` for details.

<h3>New syntax for workflow handlers</h3>

The workflow `onComplete` and `onError` handlers were previously defined by calling `workflow.onComplete` and `workflow.onError` in the pipeline script. You can now define handlers as `onComplete` and `onError` sections in an entry workflow:

```nextflow
workflow {
    main:
    // ...

    onComplete:
    println "workflow complete"

    onError:
    println "error: ${workflow.errorMessage}"
}
```

This syntax is simpler and easier to use with the {ref}`strict syntax <strict-syntax-page>`. See {ref}`workflow-handlers` for details.

<h3>Improved handling of dynamic directives</h3>

The {ref}`strict syntax <strict-syntax-page>` allows dynamic process directives to be specified without a closure:

```nextflow
process hello {
    queue (entries > 100 ? 'long' : 'short')

    input:
    tuple val(entries), path('data.txt')

    script:
    """
    your_command --here
    """
}
```

See {ref}`dynamic-directives` for details.

<h3>Configurable date formatting</h3>

You can now customize the date and time format used in notifications, reports, and console output using the `NXF_DATE_FORMAT` environment variable:

```bash
# Default format
# e.g., 11-Aug-2016 09:40:20

# Use ISO format with timezone
export NXF_DATE_FORMAT="iso"
# e.g., 2016-08-11T09:40:20+02:00

# Use custom format
export NXF_DATE_FORMAT="yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm"
# e.g., 2016-08-11 09:40
```

This feature addresses previous inconsistencies in timestamp representations.

## Breaking changes

- The AWS Java SDK used by Nextflow was upgraded from v1 to v2, which introduced some breaking changes to the `aws.client` config options. See {ref}`the guide <aws-java-sdk-v2-page>` for details.

## Deprecations

- The legacy type detection of CLI parameters is disabled when using the strict syntax (`NXF_SYNTAX_PARSER=v2`). {ref}`Legacy parameters <workflow-params-legacy>` in the strict syntax should not rely on legacy type detection. Alternatively, use the new `params` block to convert CLI parameters based on their type annotations. Legacy type detection can be disabled globally by setting the environment variable `NXF_DISABLE_PARAMS_TYPE_DETECTION=true`.

- The use of workflow handlers in the configuration file has been deprecated. You should define workflow handlers in the pipeline script or a plugin instead. See {ref}`config-workflow-handlers` for details.
