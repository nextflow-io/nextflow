# Migrating to 25.10 (preview)

This page summarizes the upcoming changes in Nextflow 25.10, which will be released in October 2025.

:::{note}
This page is a work in progress and will be updated as features are finalized. It should not be considered complete until the 25.10 release.

## Enhancements

<h3>New syntax for workflow handlers</h3>

The workflow `onComplete` and `onError` handlers were previously defined by calling `workflow.onComplete` and `workflow.onError` in the pipeline script. You can now define handlers as `onComplete` and `onError` sections in an entry workflow:

```nextflow
workflow {
    main:
    // ...

    onComplete:
    println "workflow complete"

    onError:
    println "error: ${workflow.errorMessage}"
}
```

This syntax is simpler and easier to use with the {ref}`strict syntax <strict-syntax-page>`. See {ref}`workflow-handlers` for details.

<h3>Configurable date and time formatting</h3>

:::{versionadded} 25.07.0-edge
:::

You can now customize the date and time format used in notifications, reports, and console output using the `NXF_DATE_FORMAT` environment variable. This addresses previous inconsistencies in timestamp representations:

```bash
# Use ISO format with timezone
export NXF_DATE_FORMAT=iso
nextflow run workflow.nf
# Output: 2016-08-11T09:40:20+02:00

# Use custom format  
export NXF_DATE_FORMAT="yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm"
nextflow run workflow.nf
# Output: 2016-08-11 09:40

# Default format includes seconds
nextflow run workflow.nf
# Output: 11-Aug-2016 09:40:20
```

The default format has been updated from `dd-MMM-yyyy HH:mm` to `dd-MMM-yyyy HH:mm:ss` (now includes seconds for better precision).

## Breaking changes

- The AWS Java SDK used by Nextflow was upgraded from v1 to v2, which introduced some breaking changes to the `aws.client` config options. See {ref}`the guide <aws-java-sdk-v2-page>` for details.

## Deprecations

- The use of workflow handlers in the configuration file has been deprecated. You should define workflow handlers in the pipeline script or a plugin instead. See {ref}`config-workflow-handlers` for details.
