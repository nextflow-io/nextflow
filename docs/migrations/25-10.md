## Enhancements

<h3>New syntax for workflow handlers</h3>

The workflow `onComplete` and `onError` handlers were previously defined by calling `workflow.onComplete` and `workflow.onError` in the pipeline script. These handlers can now be defined as `onComplete` and `onError` sections in an entry workflow:

```nextflow
workflow {
    main:
    // ...

    onComplete:
    println "workflow complete"

    onError:
    println "error: ${workflow.errorMessage}"
}
```

This syntax is simpler and easier to use with the {ref}`strict syntax <strict-syntax-page>`. See {ref}`workflow-handlers` for details.

## Breaking changes

- The AWS Java SDK used by Nextflow was upgraded from v1 to v2, which introduced some breaking changes to the `aws.client` config options. See {ref}`the guide <aws-java-sdk-v2-page>` for details.

## Deprecations

- The use of workflow handlers in the configuration file has been deprecated. These workflow handlers should be defined in the pipeline script or a plugin instead. See {ref}`config-workflow-handlers` for details.
