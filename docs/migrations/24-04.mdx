# Migrating to 24.04

[Nextflow 24.04](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow/releases/tag/v24.04.0) was released on May 20, 2024.

## New features

### Topic channels (first preview)

A topic channel is a channel that can receive values from multiple sources, based on a matching name or *topic*.

Topic channels are particularly useful for collecting metadata from various points in a pipeline without writing all of the channel logic that is normally required (e.g., using the `mix` operator).

See [topic][channel-topic] for details.

### Process `eval` outputs

A process `eval` output is a new type of process output that captures the standard output of an arbitrary shell command.

This output type is a simpler way to capture command outputs, such as the version of a command-line tool, instead of using a `path` or `env` output.

See [Eval output (`eval`)][process-out-eval] for details.

### Resource limits

The `resourceLimits` process directive allows you to define global limits on the resources requested by individual tasks.

This directive is useful for ensuring that a task's resource requirements never exceed system-wide limits. It is especially important for preventing tasks from becoming unschedulable when using retry with [dynamic resources][dynamic-task-resources].

See [resourceLimits][process-resourcelimits] for details.

### Job arrays

The `array` directive allows a process to submit jobs as *job arrays*, a feature used by many batch schedulers to submit many similar jobs in an efficient manner.

:::tip
On Google Batch, the `array` directive can be used in conjunction with the `cpus`, `memory`, and `machineType` directives to pack multiple tasks onto the same VM.

See [array][process-array] for details.

### Workflow outputs (first preview)

Workflow outputs are a new way to publish outputs at the workflow level:

```nextflow
nextflow.preview.output = true

workflow {
  main:
  ch_fastqc = fastqc(data)
  multiqc(ch_fastqc.collect())

  publish:
  ch_fastqc >> 'qc'
  multiqc.out >> 'summary'
}

output {
  directory 'results'
  mode 'copy'
}
```

This syntax allows you to publish channels in a workflow, instead of publishing file patterns in a process using `publishDir`.

See [Workflow outputs][workflow-output-def] for details.

## Enhancements

### Colored logs

Nextflow's console output now features colored logs and improved organization to highlight the most important information about a pipeline while it's running.

### AWS Fargate

Nextflow now supports AWS Fargate for the AWS Batch executor. See [AWS Fargate][aws-fargate] for details.

### OCI auto-pull mode for Singularity and Apptainer

The `singularity.ociAutoPull` (`apptainer.ociAutoPull`) config option enables OCI auto-pull mode for Singularity (Apptainer). When enabled, this setting allows Singularity (Apptainer) to download and convert Docker images during task execution rather than on the Nextflow head node.

See [singularity][config-singularity] and [apptainer][config-apptainer] for details.

### Improved publish error handling

The publishing logic used by `publishDir` and workflow outputs will automatically retry failed publish operations with exponential backoff, providing better resilience against transient errors. The retry behavior can be controlled using the `nextflow.publish.retryPolicy.*` config settings.

Additionally, the `failOnError` option of the `publishDir` directive is now `true` by default. This means that, by default, publish errors (after retries) will cause the pipeline to fail. To restore the previous behavior, set `failOnError` to `false` for each `publishDir` directive.

:::note
The `nextflow.publish` config settings have since been moved to `workflow.output`. See [workflow][config-workflow] for details.

### GA4GH TES 1.1

The TES executor has been updated to be compliant with version 1.1 of the [TES API specification](https://ga4gh.github.io/task-execution-schemas/docs/). Notable improvements include support for directory outputs, glob outputs, and the `bin` directory.

:::note
The `nf-ga4gh` plugin has since been moved into its own repository, [nextflow-io/nf-ga4gh](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nf-ga4gh). Refer to this repository for documentation and the latest updates on GA4GH integrations for Nextflow.

## Breaking changes

- Support for [Glacier auto-retrieval][config-aws] was removed. Consider using the AWS CLI to restore Glacier objects before or at the beginning of your pipeline.

- The `seqera` and `defaults` channels were removed from the list of default conda channels used by Wave. They can be restored with the following setting:

  ```groovy
  conda.channels = ['seqera', 'conda-forge', 'bioconda', 'defaults']
