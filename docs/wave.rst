Wave containers
****************

`Wave <https://seqera.io/wave/>`_ is a container provisioning service integrated with Nextflow. It allows the building,
uploading and managing of container images required by your data analysis workflows on-demand, during the pipeline execution in a fully automated manner.

Getting started
===============

.. note::
 This feature requires Nextflow ``22.10.0`` or later.

Nextflow installation
---------------------

If you have already installed Nextflow, update to the latest version using this command::

   nextflow -self-update

If you don't have Nextflow already installed, install it with the command below::

   curl get.nextflow.io | bash

Wave configuration
------------------

Wave can be used in any Nextflow pipeline by adding the following snippet to your ``nextflow.config`` file::

   wave {
     enabled = true
   }

   tower {
     accessToken = '<your access token>'
   }

.. tip::
  The use of the Tower access token is not mandatory, however, it's required to enable access to private repositories
  and it allows higher service rate limits compared to anonymous users.

Use cases
=========

Authenticate private repositories
---------------------------------

Wave allows the use of private repositories in your Nextflow pipelines. The repository access keys need to be provided
via the `Nextflow Tower credentials <https://help.tower.nf/22.2/credentials/overview/>`_ manager feature.

Once the credentials have been created, you only need to specify your `Tower account access token <https://help.tower.nf/22.2/api/overview/#authentication>`_
in your pipeline configuration file. If the credentials were created in a Tower organization workspace, specify the workspace ID
as well in the config file as shown below::

    tower {
      accessToken = '<your access token>'
      workspaceId = '<your workspace id>'
    }

Build module containers
-----------------------

Wave can build and provision container images on-demand for your Nextflow pipelines.

To enable this feature, add the Dockerfile of the container to be built in the :ref:`module directory <dsl2-module-directory>`
where the pipeline process is defined. When Wave is enabled, it automatically uses the Dockerfile to build the required container,
upload to the registry, and uses the container to carry out the tasks defined in the module.

.. tip::
 Make sure the process does not declare a ``container`` directive, otherwise it will take precedence over
 the Dockerfile definition.

If a process uses a ``container`` directive and you still want to build the container using the Dockerfile provided in
the module directory, add the following setting to the pipeline config file::

   wave.strategy = ['dockerfile','container']

The above line instructs Wave to give the module Dockerfile priority over process ``container`` directives.

.. warning::
 Wave currently does not support ``ADD``, ``COPY`` and other Dockerfile commands that access files in the host
 file system.

Build Conda based containers
----------------------------

Wave allows the provisioning of containers based on the :ref:`process-conda` directive used by the processes in your
pipeline. This is a quick alternative to building Conda packages in the local computer. Moreoever, this enables the use of
Conda packages in your pipeline when deploying it in cloud-native platforms such as AWS Batch and Kubernetes,
which do not allow the (easy) use of the Conda package manager.

Having Wave enabled in your pipeline, there's nothing else to do other than define the ``conda`` requirements in
the pipeline processes provided the same process does not also specify a ``container`` directive or a Dockerfile.

In the latter case, add the following setting to your pipeline configuration::

   wave.strategy = ['conda']

The above setting instructs Wave to only use the ``conda`` directive to provision the pipeline containers, ignoring the use of
the ``container`` directive and any Dockerfile(s).

Push to a private repository
----------------------------

Containers built by Wave are uploaded to the Wave default repository hosted on AWS ECR with name
``195996028523.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/wave/build``. The images in this repository are automatically deleted
after 1 week from the date of their push.

If you want to store Wave containers in your own container repository use the following settings in
the Nextflow configuration file::

   wave.build.repository = 'example.com/your/build-repo'
   wave.build.cacheRepository = 'example.com/your/cache-repo'

The first repository is used to store the built container images. The second one is used to store the individual image layers for caching purposes.

The repository access keys need to be specified using the Tower credentials manager as specified in the
`Authenticate private repositories`_ section.


Advanced settings
==================

The following configuration options are available:

============================================== =================
Name                                           Description
============================================== =================
wave.enabled                                    Enable/disable the execution of Wave containers
wave.endpoint                                   The Wave service endpoint (default: ``https://wave.seqera.io``)
wave.build.repository                           The container repository where image built by Wave needs to be uploaded (note: the corresponding credentials need to be provided in your Nextflow Tower account).
wave.build.cacheRepository                      The container repository used to cache image layers build by the Wave service (note: the corresponding credentials need to be provided in your Nextflow Tower account).
wave.conda.mambaImage                           The Mamba container image is used to build Conda based container. This is expected to be `micromamba-docker <https://github.com/mamba-org/micromamba-docker>`_ image.
wave.conda.commands                             One or more commands to be added to the Dockerfile used by build a Conda based image.
wave.strategy                                   The strategy to be used when resolving ambiguous Wave container requirement (default: ``'container,dockerfile,conda'``)
