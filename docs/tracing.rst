Tracing & visualisation
***********************

Nextflow can produce an execution tracing report that provides some information for a basic performance analysis
of a pipeline execution. A more advanced analysis is possible by using the `Extrae` and `Paraver` tools integrated with Nextflow.


.. _trace-report:

Execution report
================

Nextflow creates an execution tracing file that contains some useful information about each process executed in your pipeline
script, including: submission time, start time, completion time, cpu and memory used.

.. warning:: This is an incubating feature. It may change in future Nextflow releases.


In order to create the execution trace file add the ``-with-trace`` command line option when launching the pipeline execution.
For example::

  nextflow run <pipeline name> -with-trace

It will create a file named ``trace.txt`` in the current directory. The content looks like the above example:

======================= ===============

.. note:: Fields marked with (*) are not available when running the tracing on Mac OSX. Also note that the Mac OSX default ``date`` utility,
  has a time resolution limited to seconds. For a more detailed time tracing it is suggested to install
  `GNU coreutils <http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/>`_ package that includes the standard one.

.. warning:: These numbers provide an estimation of the resources used by running tasks. They should not be intended as an alternative
  to low level performance analysis provided by other tools and they may not be fully accurate, in particular for very short tasks
  (taking less than one minute).

Trace report layout and other configuration settings can be specified by using the ``nextflow.config`` configuration file.

Please read :ref:`Trace scope <config-trace>` section to learn more about it.


Timeline report
===============

Nextflow can render an HTML timeline for all processes executed in your pipeline. An example of the timeline
report is shown below:

.. image:: images/timeline.png


Each bar represents a process run in the pipeline execution. The bar length represents the task duration time (wall-time).
The colored area in each bar represents the real execution time. The grey area to the *left* of the colored area represents
the task scheduling wait time. The grey area to the *right* of the colored area represents the task termination time
(clean-up and file un-staging). The numbers on the x-axis represent the time in absolute units eg. minutes, hours, etc.

Each bar displays two numbers: the task duration time and the virtual memory size peak.

As each process can spawn many tasks, colors are used to identify those tasks belonging to the same process.


To enable the creation of the timeline report add the ``-with-timeline`` command line option when launching the pipeline
execution. For example::

  nextflow run <pipeline name> -with-timeline [file name]

The report file name can be specified as an optional parameter following the timeline option.


DAG visualisation
=================

A Nextflow pipeline is implicitly modelled by a direct acyclic graph (DAG). The vertices in the graph represent
the pipeline's processes and operators, while the edges represent the data connections (i.e. channels) between them.

The pipeline execution DAG can be outputted by adding the ``-with-dag`` option to the run command line.
It creates a file named ``dag.dot`` containing a textual representation of the pipeline execution graph
in the `DOT format <http://www.graphviz.org/content/dot-language>`_.

The execution DAG can be rendered in a different format by specifying an output file name which has an extension
corresponding to the required format. For example::

    nextflow run <script-name> -with-dag flowchart.png


List of supported file formats:

============ ====================
Extension     File format
============ ====================
dot           Graphviz DOT file
html          HTML file
pdf           PDF file (*)
png           PNG file (*)
svg           SVG file (*)
============ ====================

.. warning:: The file formats marked with a `*` require the `Graphviz <http://www.graphviz.org>`_ tool installed
  in your computer.

The DAG produced by Nextflow for the `Shootstrap <https://github.com/cbcrg/shootstrap/>`_ pipeline:

.. image:: images/dag.png



Extrae integration
==================


Nextflow integrates the support for `Extrae`_ a library for performance tracing. Trace files
created by Extrae can be analysed with `Paraver`_, a visual performance analysis tool.

*Extrae* together with *Paraver* will allows you to analyse the execution performance of your
pipeline.

.. note:: Both *Extrae* and *Paraver* are tools developed by the `Barcelona Supercomputing Center`_.


How to use it
---------------

This feature currently depends on a custom version of Extrae 2.5.0 that needs to be installed in
the computer where the pipeline is executed.

.. warning:: This is an incubating feature. It may change in future Nextflow releases.

Pre-requisite
---------------

* Install ``libxml2``
* Install ``binutils``

If you are using an Ubuntu Linux distribution these packages can be installed using the following
commands::

    sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev binutils-dev


It may change depending your Linux distribution and the available package installer tool.

Installation
------------

Download the Extrae 2.5.0 at this link http://www.nextflow.io/misc/extrae-2.5.0.tar.gz

Compile and install it by using the following command::

  ./configure \
   --without-mpi \
   --without-unwind \
   --without-dyninst \
   --without-papi \
   --without-java \
   --prefix=<extrae_install_dir>

  make
  make install


When the compilation process is completed define the following variables in your
environment profile file::

  export EXTRAE_HOME=<extrae_install_dir>
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:${EXTRAE_HOME}/lib


Profile your pipeline
---------------------

In order to use the Extrae tracing simply add the option ``-with-extrae`` to your Nextflow
launch command line, for example::

  nextflow run <your pipeline> -with-extrae


When the pipeline execution completes, other then the expected result files, it will produce the Extrae
trace file having the following name: ``TRACE.mpits``

Converts this file to the Paraver format by using the following command::

  ${EXTRAE_HOME}/bin/mpi2prv -task-view -f TRACE.mpits -o <your file name>.prv


Analysis with Paraver
---------------------

If do not have Paraver installed, you need to download and install it in your computer.
You can download it from this page: http://www.bsc.es/performance_tools/downloads

Use the ``File > Load Trace`` command in the Paraver menu to load the trace file
(the file with ``.prv`` suffix).

To perform a basic analysis download the `configuration file available
at this link <http://www.nextflow.io/misc/nextflow_runtime_analysis.cfg>`_ and open it
by using the command ``File -> Load Configuration`` in the Paraver menu.

It defines some views useful to observe the different tasks duration.

Please refers the `Paraver`_ documentation for information about it.


Advanced configuration
----------------------

In order to fine control the Extra tracing you can provide a custom Extrae
configuration file by specifying its location by using the environment
variable ``EXTRAE_CONFIG_FILE``.

Read the `Extrae`_ documentation for more information about it.
