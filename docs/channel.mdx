# Channels

In Nextflow, **channels** are the key data structures that facilitate the dataflow dependencies between each step (i.e. [Processes][process-page]) in a pipeline.

There are two kinds of channels, *queue channels* and *value channels*. Channels are created using *channel factories* and transformed using *channel operators*.

### Queue channel

A *queue channel* is a channel that *emits* an asynchronous sequence of values.

A queue channel can be created by channel factories (e.g., [of][channel-of] and [fromPath][channel-path]), operators (e.g., [map][operator-map] and [flatMap][operator-flatmap]), and processes (see [Process outputs][process-output]).

### Value channel

A *value channel* is a channel that is *bound* to an asynchronous value.

A value channel can be created with the [value][channel-value] factory, certain operators (e.g., [collect][operator-collect] and [reduce][operator-reduce]), and processes (under [certain conditions][process-out-singleton]).

The values in a queue channel cannot be accessed directly -- they can only be accessed by passing the channel as input to an operator or process. For example:

```nextflow
channel.value(1).view { v -> "value channel is ${v}" }
```

```console
value channel is 1
```

## Channel factories

Channel factories are functions that create channels from regular values.

The `channel.fromPath()` factory creates a channel from a file name or glob pattern, similar to the `files()` function:

```nextflow
channel.fromPath('input/*.txt').view()
```

See [Channel factories][channel-factory] for the full list of channel factories.

## Operators

Channel operators, or *operators* for short, are functions that consume and produce channels. Because channels are asynchronous, operators are necessary to manipulate the values in a channel. Operators are particularly useful for implementing glue logic between processes.

Commonly used operators include:

- [combine][operator-combine]: emit the combinations of two channels
- [collect][operator-collect]: collect the values from a channel into a list
- [filter][operator-filter]: select the values in a channel that satisfy a condition
- [flatMap][operator-flatMap]: transform each value from a channel into a list and emit each list element separately
- [groupTuple][operator-grouptuple]: group the values from a channel based on a grouping key
- [join][operator-join]: join the values from two channels based on a matching key
- [map][operator-map]: transform each value from a channel with a mapping function
- [mix][operator-mix]: emit the values from multiple channels
- [view][operator-view]: print each value in a channel to standard output

See [Operators][operator-page] for the full list of operators.
