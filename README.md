Nextflow is a workflow manager for developing scalable, portable, and reproducible workflows. It can deploy workflows on a variety of execution platforms including local, HPC schedulers, AWS Batch, Azure Batch, Google Cloud Batch, and Kubernetes. Additionally, it supports many ways to manage your software dependencies, including Conda, Spack, Docker, Podman, Singularity, and more.

Quick start
===========

Install Nextflow with a single command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.nextflow.io | bash
```

It creates the `nextflow` executable file in the current directory. You can then move it to a directory in your `$PATH` to run it from anywhere.

Nextflow can also be installed from Bioconda:

```bash
conda install -c bioconda nextflow
```
