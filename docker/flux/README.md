# Flux Container Environment

In this directory we include a [Dockerfile](.devcontainer/Dockerfile)
along with a [VSCode Developer Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) 
environment that you can put at the root of the project to be provided with a Flux agent and the dependencies
needed to build Nextflow. See the [documentation](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/flux.html) 
for the latest for how to use them.
