Hi! Thanks for using Nextflow. 

If you need help about Nextflow scripting language, 
configuration options and general Nextflow usage the better 
channels to post this kind of questions are: 

* Google group: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nextflow
* Gitter channel: https://gitter.im/nextflow-io/nextflow


Also you may also want to have a look at the patterns page 
for common solutions to recurrent implementation problems:
