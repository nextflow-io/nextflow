about: Need for help on Nextflow language and usage

Hi! Thanks for using Nextflow. 

If you need help about Nextflow scripting language, 
configuration options and general Nextflow usage the better 
channels to post this kind of questions are: 

* GitHub discussions: https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow/discussions
* Slack community chat: https://www.nextflow.io/slack-invite.html


Also you may also want to have a look at the patterns page 
for common solutions to recurrent implementation problems:
