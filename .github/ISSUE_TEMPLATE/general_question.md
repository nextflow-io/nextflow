about: Need for help on Nextflow language and usage
---

Hi! Thanks for using Nextflow. 

If you need help about Nextflow scripting language, 
configuration options and general Nextflow usage the better 
channels to post this kind of questions are: 

* GitHub discussions: https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow/discussions
* Slack community chat: https://join.slack.com/t/nextflow/shared_invite/zt-11iwlxtw5-R6SNBpVksOJAx5sPOXNrZg


Also you may also want to have a look at the patterns page 
for common solutions to recurrent implementation problems:
